"Don't use with batteries!
	The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.

I had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries.  Don't make this mistake"	0
"Not to Impressed
	Works well on carpets not to well anywhere else.  The hose attachment is horrible, the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum, and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off.  I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I need to be able to clean the furniture.  Also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood, it was not pulled into the bag. Very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets."	0
"know what you're buying
	The International Eversharp line is Henckels low-end, stamped stainless line.  It is not carbon steel. It is not hand-forged.  It does not compare to the other Henckels lines which are.  You get what you pay for.  These are cheap knives.

This is the first time I have seen a set of Henckels knives which could go in the dishwasher....but, that's because on this line, you do not get Henckels lifetime warranty (which is voided by dishwasher use)"	0
"Shrinks and sheds when things get hot
	This is the worst basting brush I have ever encountered.  At first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time I washed it.  (Although it's dishwasher safe, it failed to come clean in there, even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it isn't spotless, but I think I pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process.)  It also doesn't stand up to any heat, I use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things (at about 375 degrees) becuase I don't like the residue left by Pam, and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time.  I also don't like the Good Grips in general (these were a gift) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers"	0
"Barely gets one star
	Last year, I bought a Pizza Stone from Pampered Chef.  It was a rousing success with my family.  For the 5 of us, however, one stone was not enough and I wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time.  Sadly, the product did not come through.  My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off.  I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time.  It stuck even worse!  The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times.  I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef.  You get what you pay for!!"	0
"Keeps coffe hot--that's its only advantage--poor performance and quality.
	Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another"	0
"WARNING!
	As Shannon says, Kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments.  But be warned: these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl!  I purchased a new Artisan mixer  and amp; ordered these to go along with it, but they are too small.  They do not fit the Artisan or KSM90 mixer bowls.  Models they fit are KBC5N, K5SS,  and amp; KSM5 only"	0
"Does non-stick refer to the packaging?
	Everything sticks to these pans! I cannot get OFF the potato residue and I'm probably just going to throw them away. 

They are awkwardly heavy. They do not warp, but they do pop out of shape (this happens when the pans are in the oven and you'll hear a very loud, scary pop). 

Just awful."	0
"Remanufactured?  No Thanks.
	Love those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing.  In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product.  What a headache!  The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot."	0
"1 Star because you can't go lower than that!
	The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing.  This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people).  At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink.  I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer.  Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper.  Also the blade takes a while to clean"	0
"Loud!
	I just bought this fan and it is too loud! Even on its lowest setting, the noise is a bit much. It does put out a stiff breeze, but I'm not sure it's worth it. My Black and Decker tower fan is better"	0
"Lock problem
	Had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock).  Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly.  However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it."	0
"Multiple Probes failed quickly; bad batch? or just plain bad?
	I've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under ""normal"" use... something goes wrong at some point, and they just don't read right anymore.

I love my Taylor digital thermometer, and these probes seem to work with the Taylor, but I went through 3 probes very quickly. I use them in my Weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking. In spite of the fact that I took care to not route the cable over a burner, or anything of that sort, each probe lasted only 5 or 6 uses.

I had ordered three at one time, and all of them failed in a similar way.

THERE ARE OTHER PROBES AVAILABLE that are better! There is one available on the Internet that is sold as a Taylor probe replacement. These probes look the same (with the 90-degree elbow bend and the right-angle mini-plug), but they have a smooth grey silicone-rubber sheathed cable, instead of a metal braid sheath.  I bought several of these (reasonably priced, around $12 or so), and so far, they have worked like champs with no failures and accurate readings from freezing to boiling.

I would not recommend these probes based on my experience with very high failure rates."	0
"Thin Sheets That Curl and Buckle in the Oven - YUK!
	I ordered 3 (2x) sets of these so that I would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets.

When they arrived, I noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that I had used previously, but my thinking was that if they baked well, that was all that counted.  I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets.

Upon the first use, when they were placed in the oven, the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin.  The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven.  Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction, and burned cookie bottoms.  This symphony of metal buckling, courtesy of my new $15 cookie sheets.

Even with the Exopat silicone sheets on them, the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap, thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to ""double pan"" to prevent burning.  What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets.

Yes, into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly, its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance.  These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they're worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares, one can infer the quality that one is getting.

I used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality, and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of, at least, mezzanine quality.  When I buy on the web and cannot better scrutinize the items I'm choosing, I tend to favor trusted brands.  As it turns out, these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand.

With the holiday baking season upon us, what do I plan to replace them with?  The Vollrath cookie sheets (not non-stick, but I use silicone mats, so do I care?) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  They're in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $19 but most vendors are out of them.  They're due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday, 10/17.  Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon, apparently.

If I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash, I would so rate them."	0
"Junk, do not waste your money
	You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend."	0

"Cuisinart HTM-5 SmartPower 5-Speed Electronic Hand Mixer
	This mixer runs too fast, even in it's lowest setting.  The beaters tend to throw food out of the mixing bowl. Uncontrolable.  Would not suggest purchasing"	0
"Not that great
	These dishes, first of all, are just beautiful.  The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous.  That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there.  I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else"	0
"Do NOT buy this
	The blender part that holds the blade broke the second time I used it to crush ice. The food processor part works ok, but the major problem is it's extremely loud. It's beyond the pain level. It's so loud, I have to use hearing protection or my ears are ringing for 15 minutes afterwards. It's louder than my circular saw"	0
"Broke
	I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years.  My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it.  It was making bread and just turned off.  We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem.  We now have to replace it.  It worked great until it just stopped working.  I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years.  Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house"	0
"Looks nice, but gears break easily
	We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties.  It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive.  After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers.  Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.
Replaced the worthless Cuisinart with a Kitchenaid.  Would recommend avoiding Cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw"	0

"sticky sticky
	to begin with..  
this pan heats up even and fast. i have a hard anodized circulon non-stick pot, a copper bottom skillet, and this calphalon pan. the heat distribution is excellent, and unlike the copper bottom pan, the calphalon is light and easy to use. 

BUT, the good stops here. the stick problem is bad, and my stainless steel copper bottom pan sticks less than this calphalon skillet. 

since it's not a non-stick pan, some sticking is expected, but clean up is just pain. regular soaking over nite will NOT help sometimes. 

if u cook vegitable and small amount of meat, this pan is good. but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan. avoid anything that will carmalize or contain high sugar. 

i once cooked some balsamic vinegar mushroom with brown sugar in this pan, and it took me forever to get it clean again since the sugar carmalization litterally stuck to the bottom."	0

"More than $20. for one plate?
	The rating I give this item relates to the lack of value.  In a few more clicks, you can buy a service-for-eight of white corelle for less than what three of these dinner plates will cost you. That said, I have owned my Corelle (two services-for-four) for more than twenty-five years, using it regularly.  All dishes are intact, they are light and stack nicely, and maybe I'm just not enough of a snob but I don't know why anyone would need any other dishes"	0

"Fondue Failure
	I really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box.  It's looks well made and looked easy to use.  I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer.  I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes.  When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad.  I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say"	0
"DO NOT BUY!  I'll sell you mine for $5.
	I've had to bring this back to Hoover 5 times in less than a year.
The belt for the self-propelled motor comes off ever other time I use the vacuum. The on/off button has been fixed 3 times.  It works when it wants to.  Even the guy at the Hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off.  I have nothing good to say about this.  I'm  a huge Consumer Reports fan but they missed the boat on this one. They need to update their testing over the long-term. I'm still pissed I blew $250 on this ridiculous excuse for a vacuum"	0
"Consumer Reports got this one wrong!
	Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports.  It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning.  I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work.  If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports"	0
"Cork Screw Failure
	Unlike the other reviewers, my Kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years. It never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me -- it didn't make cork pulling labor-free -- but I found it much easier than any previous such tool I ever owned. Alas, as in many of the other reviews, the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable. A cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service. I just visited the Kitchenaid web page and they don't offer a cork screw for sale anymore. I presume that I will soon toss mine as well. Planning to buy one of these for $30? Clint would ask you: Do you feel lucky"	0
"engineering missed again
	its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage. So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?"	0
"If I could actually get one that worked, maybe I'd like it.
	I ordered the My Cafe from Amazon in early October and received it a few days later. On initial set-up, the unit failed to prime. I talked to Bunn's Service Dept. and was coached to try several steps, which did not work. I was given a return authorization number and told that I would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one. I have Fed Ex verification that the My Cafe was received by Bunn on October 18. I called Bunn on November 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes. No return call came. I called again on November 9th and was told that the My Cafe has been on back order and that I am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment. They could not, or would not, give me any meaningful information on when I might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original. My Cafe may be a great machine but Bunn's service is atrocious"	0
"Too much work, didn't last long
	The Amco sifter broke during the second time I was using it and the first time I used it it took a long time and the handle kept sticking.

	It looked like a great Idea, just what I needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep.  Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design.  There is a finger  and quot;crush area and quot; near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it.

"Fooled Me Once, Shame on You. Fooled Me Twice, Shame on Me
	That's right.  I got taken twice.  I bought this cooker for under $20 a few years ago, and it died after the second use.  Considering it was so inexpensive, I just bought another one.  It died again after only one use.  I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem.

"My husband almost burned the house down...
	I myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months.
So after reading the other reviews, I'm no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine...and it won't be a Delonghi"	0
"A Big Mistake
	Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill."	0

"Chips ahoy!
	The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips.

That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day."	0
"Great Value BUT!!!
	The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan"	0
"Problems
	With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected"	0
"Do not recommend
	I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan"	0
"Poor Quality
	I also tried some cotton Wamsutta sheets from Bed Bath, and Beyond and they pilled the first time I washed them.  I was able to return them to the store, but it was a waste of time.  I wouldn't recommend these sheets or any Wamsutta sheets because I think they're poor quality"	0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would
	Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again"	0
"I loved it until it broke after 3 months of use
	The fan was great, with lots of breeze and circulation. It is loud, but who cared? 
The problem is that it only lasted for about 3 months before it just quit working, along with a little puff of smoke. Two weeks before the fatal puff, the fan arced, popped, sparked, and gave off a puff of smoke, but it still worked. Two weeks after that it sparked and puffed and has not turned on since.
I live in Hawaii and it is currently in the rainy season. There has been a lot of humidity in the air during the last month, and I noticed that the back of the fan was actually getting rusty. I thought perhaps that moisture was the cause of the sparking so I was surprised to read in another review that the fan was good to use during heat and humidity!
The fan was sitting in front of the living room window and it kept the whole small 2 bedroom house cool. We miss it, but I can't keep buying a new fan every 3 months! 
This is the first time ever that this has happened with a fan that I purchased. I have been living in Hawaii for 13 years and have been through a lot of fans. One of the best-lasting fans I had was a $10.00 Lasko box fan. It lasted and worked well for 7 years before it quit working"	0

"Buyer beware!
	When I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.  That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money's worth.

The positive review from America's Test Kitchen is what pointed me in this direction.  The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat.  All of the positive comments are accurate at first.

The problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely.  I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat.  I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic.  I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface.

I have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago.  With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly.  Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault.  Why waste $10 in shipping costs?  This is my last Farberware product.

After writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond.  After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn't really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful.  BUYER BEWARE"	0

	When it worked it worked well.  However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken.  I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up.  I can see a line here and there, but nothing else.  Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information.  It is defintely NOT worth $30"	0
"Rust on knives
	Have been using the set for less than a month. Rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles - right at the seams. Looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle. Unless design is changed, don't know how replacement knives will be any different. Too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully"	0

"Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle
	Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. 

While you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.  There are better kettles around"	0
"Watch the handle!
	I agree with the previous reviewers.  The style is quite sleek and the ceramic, earthen material eliminates the metallic taste of the water.  

However, the handle is a huge problem and you have to be extremely careful when pouring the pot. I made a hot of tea only filling 1/2 way full and put pouring it the handle can apart from the kettle and smash went the kettle, leaving me standing with only the handle in my hand. Thankfully I was pouring this over the sink or I would've suffered quite a burn.

Buyer beware"	0
"awful
	Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish.  My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.  I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for long

I am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental.  After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp.  Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads.  After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.  I had taken some  comfort in the ""lifetime"" warantee, I tried to return them, but the warantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless"	0
"More of a toy than actual need
	I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it"	0
"Nearly caught on fire, ruined my shirt
	This iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while I was using it.  I was pressing a shirt when suddenly the LED display on the iron shut off and started beeping repeatedly.  I smelled smoke and the handle was hot to the touch.  I lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark ON MY BRAND NEW SHIRT!

I do NOT recommend this iron -- you risk burning your clothes"	0
"Very tasty, very big mess!!
	I love Kitchenaid products, but this one failed miserably!!
The taste of the coffee is excellent, but there were grounds and coffee everywhere.  The Pause N Serve feature works as it brews!!  I don't think that was the intention though.  When I called the company the not so brilliant guy told me that they hear this all the time on this model and that you just have to push the coffee maker in far enough so that the pause n serve feature isn't activated...well, unless we put a heavy ceramic bowl in front of the carafe to hold the pot in place we have coffee soup all over our counter and floor.  

My husband and I love coffee and we like it STRONG!  We feel coffee is very important to survival in our home as we have 5 kids and this helps us stay alive and energetic for the 48 hours a day we care for them!!  

My strong advice...don't but this model.  Though Kitchenaid is a great product and I have never had problems with any of their other lines, this one should be junked!  We are returning ours!"	0

"Save your money
	I've been using a large Cusinart for over 10 years.  It is marvelous, so I decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs.

"Loved it until this morning.
	I have had the Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffeemaker for about six months or so and loved it.  This morning, however, it decided to stop working correctly.   I left the kitchen while it was brewing and all of the coffee leaked all over the counter.  What a mess!  I then made just 2 cups and put a coffee cup under the spout and watched it.  Sure enough as the coffee was brewing the spout was spewing.  I don't know what coffeemaker to buy now"	0
"Great ... as long as it worked
	I used this thermometer fewer than 10 times before it stopped working.  For the most part, it no longer registers any temperature, and when it does it reads 75-100 degrees too cool.  While it was working, I definitely preferred it to my analog candy thermometer because it was less bulky, but I certainly can't recommend it now.  

The clip still works, though, and coupled with my wonderful Polder probe thermometer, I've got the best candy thermometer ever"	0
"No Need for Cups, Slurp It Off the Counter
	We received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law.  She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us.  Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking.  She thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers.

We used our BrewStation for the first time yesterday.  The night before, I set it up and programmed it to make coffee at 5:00 AM - perfect, we could get up and have coffee already made.  It worked great.  A minor problem is that I enjoy coffee throughout the morning and the coffeemaker shut off after two hours.  Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, I just turned it back on and life was good.

Now before I go on with my story, I need to explain how this coffeemaker works.  You pour the water into the first reservoir (for water only) using the coffee tank to measure the amount of water.  The coffee tank is placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is placed in a basket that fits on top of the coffee tank.  The coffee is made and held in the coffee tank.  To dispense the coffee, you place your cup below the tank and push on the dispenser button with your cup.  Coffee pours right into the cup.  Great idea, too bad it doesn't work as well as the concept!

Today coffee was brewed at 5:00 AM again.  That's the only thing that worked well.  When my husband tried to get a cup of coffee it poured out and would not stop.  The cup overflowed, the coffee ran all over the counter and continued to flow until he unplugged it and put the entire coffeemaker in the sink.  It finally stopped pouring out when it ran out of coffee.  I've cleaned the coffee tank and it continues to pour no matter what I do.  Since this coffeemaker runs just under $ 50, the twelve cups of coffee we've made with it very expensive!

I've emailed Hamilton Beach and am awaiting an answer to this dilemma.  I need to purchase another coffeemaker today and it definitely won't be a Hamilton Beach brand.  I can't afford to purchase a new coffeemaker every other day!

My advice is to purchase a different brand and stay away from this one.  Unless you don't have cups and want to slurp your coffee off of the counter!"	0
"Mechanics are faulty
	We have had this toaster for approximately 3 yrs.  It has had mimimal use as we
vacation away from home in the winter ( 4 months at least).  There are just two
people using this toaster and on an average only  use it twice a week.  The toaster is
a part time toaster, sometimes it will toast both sides sometimes not.  It has
now become a total pain as the mechanism to hold the bread down has stopped
working.   I thought that a Cuisinart would last for ever.  I owned a very cheap
toaster for over 35 years, gave it to my sons to use in college.  That toaster still
functions properly but is small and a 2 slicer.  It will come out of the attic until

It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place).  I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this.  Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust.  I'm very disappointed"	0
"FIRE HAZARD
	I bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets.  I used it once without a problem, seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac.  The 2nd time I used it I was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box.  The 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working.  I turned the machine off, checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing.  I manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem, so i turned it back on.  It was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning.  I turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily, which lasted for at least 2-3 minutes before cooling off. Don't waste your $$ on this and more importantly don't risk your safety with this fire trap"	0
"Spout that spills and leaks....for shame!
	Who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily? since it doesn't make any noise that it is boiling, you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing. And what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways? Welding is a skill that if done right, it would NOT leak! The handle will get hot so wear your glove. On the plus side, the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place. I use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable (lasted 2 years) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more, it don't mean it would last longer. Mine start to leak after 4 months. I am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it. 

Overall, i cannot recommend this tea pot due to the spout flaw."	0

"You cannot make pancakes or eggs on this pan...

I could not get the pancakes off the bottom of the pan without destroying them.

This might be a good pan for searing and the cleanup that comes with it, but it is definitely NOT a pan to make breakfast or any other meal that requires a non-stick pan.

"Does not live up to function as claimed
	I bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.

The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was ""probably trashed"". She was right. If you want  to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether"	0

	We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped.  We looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task.

Out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this Black  and  Decker.  At first it seemed ""ok"", but after just a few months we are back to using our old ""manual - hand wind"" opener.  The reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes.  Over time (not much time!) it gets too loose to hold a can anymore.  We lock it in place, it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter.  Repeat this scene over and over...!  At the end, the lid is never (REPEAT - NEVER!) separated from the can - ever!

"worse than scooping everyday
	I bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago. It turned out to be more work than just a regular box. At least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean. Good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears. It gets to be a disgusting affair, more than with a regular box. 

As other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there's tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out. It was often unable to push the clumps into the bin. So it would just very noisily push until it got stuck, back up, and then start over again like 10 times in a row. When it does get clumps into the bin, it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you're left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box. To clean it, you have to take it apart. The top part houses a computer so you can't soak it which means there's poo always stuck in the crevices. Ever see Office Space? At the end of two months I was ready to bring this thing out in a field and bash it with a sledgehammer. 

Now we're looking for another box. Currently, we are just using the plastic box from the littermaid without the rake, etc. This is my worst investment to date."	0
"Good while it lasts
	I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as ""wireless"" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill.  Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?"	0

Now for the negative aspects of this item:  it's WAY over-priced, especially for how poorly it is designed. The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a ""Good Grip,"" which is ironic since it's called the ""OXO Good Grips"" oven mitt.  It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures.  I strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this OXO mitt, you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design."	0
"Mystery Plan
	As of today August 19, I have not received anything on this plan.
 No paperwork,no backorder....NOTHING !!!
 I think maybe it's just a rip-off"	0
"waste of money
	I am very disappointed in this product.  I followed all the ""mfgs. directions"" on how to keep this board in great shape but it didn't matter. the board bowed and cracked after about 2 months (30 days over the Amazon warranty of course....)  it's so badly curved we are waiting for it to turn into a sphere."	0
"Ours died too.
	We used our beloved panini maker probably once a month or so for about a year, but it died without warning, and way too soon"	0
"Disappointed
	Very noisy and takes too long to brew.  Boxed it up to return but I misplaced the packing slip.  Will keep using mom's very old Corelle electric percolator"	0
"Not a good foam pump.
	The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet.  (Children would love this feature.)  You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm.  Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually.  You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use"	0
"Unsuitable for Brown Rice
	I spent several hours searching  and amp; researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice  and quot;measurements and quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the  and quot;keep warm and quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet  and amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice"	0
"Stay away from this Item!!!
	I LOVE to grill but I keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment I had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter.  First, it took more than 1/2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other.  Secondly, and worst of all, on just my second attempt using it I was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to ""HIGH"".  I immediately went out to check it and the probe is DEAD!!!  There's no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer!!  Taylor is NO HELP!"	0
"It's true: this non-stick pan is not what it pretends to be.
	This product is a disgrace. Nonstick is not one of its virtues, and those who are thinking of purchasing this waste of money should be forewarned. It is not even well designed for broiling with small openings for fat drainage that quickly clog up. I am honestly surprised that Amazon would allow such an unworthy product to be sold under its banner"	0
"I received this as a Christmas gift
	When I opened the box, I noticed corrosion on the lid.  When I contacted Rival customer service via email, they told me I had to purchase a new lid.  I called and spoke with a customer service representative and they told me that a lid was not covered under warranty.  When I explained that I just opened it and it was defective they told me to just return the product that there was nothing that they were going to do.  

After being treated this way, I will NOT be purchasing any more Rival products if they don't stand behind their product!!!!!  VERY VERY poor customer service"	0

"Not up to Calphalon standards
	I purchased these pans based on my previous positive experiences with Calphalon cookware--have tons of it, but I experienced the same problem as two other reviewers--that is, the slumping in the middle.  I have been cooking for over 30 years and have never experienced this problem, especially since I have a new Kitchen-Aid convection oven.  Also, the  and quot;non-stick and quot; is not so  and quot;non-stick and quot;.   At their prices, I think they have a little work to do to meet other Calphalon products"	0
"poor pour
	yes, it looks good in my blue kitchen. but the water doesn't pour cleanly out of the spout - it's more like uncontrollable spewing, even when ""poured"" slowly, and boiling water splashes all over the counter. also very difficult to fully empty. sorry I threw out the box, or I'd send back"	0
"burns toast
	This toaster at the lowest setting of 1 burns my toast.  It also burned one side of a frozen bagel when I put it on defrost.

Further, when plugged in, the dial is lit up by a red light.  It makes me feel like the toaster is on, and needs to be turned off.  I have to keep reminding myself that it is okay.  If I can find the box, I'll probably return it.  Maybe I just got a dud, since most reviews here are goo"	0
"Mislabeled size
	The 4-cup coffee press is in actuality just 2 cups. The number of ounces is not listed in the sales blurb... What we wanted was 4 cups at 8 ounces each. The 4-cup coffee press is just a bit over 16 ounces. While it says so on the lid of the box it came in, the ounce-capacity is not in the Amazon listing. ...So we returned it.."	0
"Way too thin!
	This product was horrible. I ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such.  However, it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it.  When I took the featherbed out of the box, it was terribly thin.  I currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy.  This item unfortunately felt as though I was simply lying on a blanket."	0
"Flimsy crap not worthy of Cuisinart brand
	Mine died after 6 months - half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread.  Took it apart - no loose or broken wires, so must have been the circuitry.  Chucked it in the garbage.
While it was working, it would jam easily.  The push-down handle has a flimsy metal tang that twists easily (when kids or oafish adults use it).  The tang then rubs against the slot, incinerating the toast"	0

	The professional 5 qt. series has a wider bowl than the regular 5 quart.  I was given no info. that it would not fit this model. I was dissapointed as I feel this attachment would be helpfu"	0
"Beautiful but not reliable
	I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  

I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.

But, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.

I did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.

From a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it's beautiful but it's not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were"	0
"Junk!
	This thing is a piece of junk! It's the only blender I've ever seen that comes with a ""stir stick"" to unclog the sides of the jar (where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades). This should have been a clue that the thing wasn't very well designed, and it wasn't. It ALWAYS needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie, several times, which made the process a real pain. Also, the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty. Except for the jar it's pretty cheap plastic. But it's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months. Good riddance"	0
"Pure Junk!
	The ""brushed chrome"" is plastic. The spout leaks, and the motor burned out in one week. On top of that the store where I purchased it, Kitchen Kapers wouldn't let me return it saying it wasn't designed for drinks that require crushing ice. Why then do some of the recipes in the manual call for ice cubes?"	0
"Coffee Tastes Bitter
	We had a Krups for about 4 years at the office and the coffee was good. We needed to replace it because the Carafe broke and there was no replacement available (they discontinued the model and the carafe - thanks Krups). So, we replaced it with the FM4. I didn't like the coffee from the start - but I figured it would get better. Two weeks later, I dumped it for a Bunn B10-B which got good ratings here. Get the Bunn - it makes a good cup of coffee.

We always use Starbuck's coffee"	0
"Tomato Killer
	My wife stopped me punishing any more innocent tomatoes when the Oxo Mandoline, my chopping board and the kitchen floor and walls were dripping with red 'stuff'.

"Not as sturdy as it looks...
	I am a man who loves his tea.  I drink up to a dozen cups a day, so I use my tea ball quite frequently.  My major complaint with most tea balls, and the reason I must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely.  Over time this gets worse, and the tea ball becomes unusable.  There are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy.  

I just got this tea ball in the mail a week ago, and while it is still usable, the clip is already losing its grip.  Look somewhere else for a tea ball."	0
"Dangerously fragile
	I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive.  I placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use, and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done.  I then checked Amazon's reviews, and found that this was a common experience.  They're going back to the store tomorrow."	0
"Seems practical, but...
	I was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized, balanced, and easy-to-carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co-workers? Yes. But practical? No."	0

"Excellent fryer
	Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after. 
Very pleased overall."	1
"Close to Perfect Bookcase
	I love this bookcase. My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split (a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it (excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal. Highly recommended"	1

"Excellent set of forged steak knives
	I have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier.  They have excellent balance and feel.  A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set.  The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice (light pine with no finish), but I don't use it anyway"	1
"Pre-seasoned is a plus, but not necessary.  Fabulous Oven!
	This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.  I purchased it pre-seasoned because I've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware.  Bottom line:  While the pre-seasoning was a plus, it's not necessary.  Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you'll be fine.

My family has had cast iron for generations, and I won't pay the exhorbitant prices for those ""upscale, professional"" dutch ovens that are all the rage these days.  This Lodge oven browns spectacularly, and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one, that's not a problem if one simply uses one's nose.  We can all tell when enough is enough...   

I particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren't present on the more expensive ones.  These spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and I don't have to worry about a dry product.  The lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which I own, and that's a plus.  It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home.  

Yes, it's heavy, but that's the nature of cast iron, no??  If you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this Lodge piece, be prepared to shell out big bucks"	1

	My mother-in-law got me one of these when I started feeding my first son baby food.  Before, I would just mash up our food with a fork.  This is much easier. I've had it for three years now and it's still working great.   

I use it for everything, now.  My husband doesn't like veggies, and I when I cook I usually put onion, celery, and bell pepper in everything.  Now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables, and he doesn't have to deal with the chunks.  Great product!"	1
"Excellent kettle, Excellent company
	I received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle (the former model) that I purchased in October 2005.

Part of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area.  My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch.  I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail.  In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed-x label.  They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it.  Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova.

I then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do.  The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty.  I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don't have with the applicances.  The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had.  It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company.

The new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil.  It also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining.  I am happy with the product, and very happy with the company's service"	1

	Pyrex is always the best!  This enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot.  The lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places.  Also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use (but not the oven) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack.  The cover has three pouring choices, a regular pour spout, a slotted spout, and a spout with seven little holes.  An extremely useful item to have in the kitchen"	1
"Worth Every Penny!
	Even if you aren't worried about the possible negative effects of drinking out of plastic or nalgene this is the best water bottle ever.

"All-Clad 16-Quart Stainless Stockpot
	Ok, this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stockpots, if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one. It is part of the disk bottom collection, however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made. I certainly would not consider it secondary. It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means. It is great for sauce, soup, stew, etc. You will love it and you can't beat the price. It is very easy to clean. A+ 
Keep an eye out, there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on Amazon and in department and cooking stores.  I actually got this stock pot free when I purchased my All-Clad Roti Pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in Filene's.  I would have bought it anyway, it is an excellent stockpot and the price can't be beat.  
Tip: If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called ""Bar Keepers Friend"" to clean it. Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc. and Bed, Bath and Beyond carry it too. The container (like a Comet can) is gold with blue and white writing. All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive."	1

"A great grater
	This grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen. It's very solidly built, unlike the old ones I have, and the non-skid base is pure genius. The grating surface is nice and sharp. I love the container that catches whatever you've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid. Although the container faithfully catches the grated material, there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese. One caveat: Since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use, you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating. Yup, I realized this the hard way, and boy was it a mess! Despite this, I highly recommend this kitchen essential"	1

A note on disassembly.  Some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug (if you own one you know what I'm talking about).   The very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine.  If you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down."	1

	This product is great for making mashed potatoes.  I love it, it is well made and sturdy.

I prefer non electric kitchen gadgets, (to save space) and this one is great."	1
"Wonderful Pan
	I recently received this pan as a gift, and have been extremely impressed with it!  The ""infused anodized"" surface performs as advertised, providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non-stick cooking.  I love the 14"" size -- it's great for those times when I used to have to split things up into more than one 10"" saute pan, as well as for one-pan stovetop-to-oven dishes.

That said, this is definitely not the right pan for you if you prefer non-stick surfaces.  You will need to use oil, butter, etc. when cooking in this pan, and things will sometimes stick.  Cleanup is very easy, though!

It is very well-constructed, and I would expect it to last a lifetime"	1

	These scissors are ideal for the kitchen. The size is nice, good grips fit well in the hand. They are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future.
I especially like that they come apart easily for cleaning... and go back together easily also.
Highly recommend if you're looking for a good quality, all-purpose kitchen scissor"	1
"A winner. You can't go wrong!!!
	These shears are indispensable. First they are sharp and stay that way---definitely not to be used by children. They will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves (but I spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone).Easy to handle. But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart. They are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for CLEANING with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way. The cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening. You'll wonder how you ever got along without them"	1
"DeLonghi Mixer
	This item was ordered to replace a Kitchen Aid unit used extensively for a number of years.  I am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients.  I first heard of the DeLonghi Mixer when it was branded Kenwood -in an Australian magazine. 

What a nice difference!  The Kitchen Aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison!!  

I love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the DeLonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner.

I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product."	1
"fantastic pan at a fantastic price
	I have been using a Cuisinart 9"" skillet for a few years now and love it - one of the best pans I've ever owned (and I've owned a few -top names too). but when my 13"" stainless steel skillet (from another name) warped under too much heat (it couldn't take the heat from my Viking Range), I immediately started a search for a Cusinart replacement. I couldn't believe the price. Fortunately I have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart doesn't come with one"	1
"A great set at an even greater price
	I've used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives. Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that. 

Using my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don't wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges. 

Last, the balance of these knives is more than adequate. I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series. All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can't justify it given that the Insignia's cut so well. My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives. And a good set of knives these are"	1
"good value
	I purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network.  I wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I'm pleased with it.  It's nice-looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price."	1
"The best grater I ever owned

	The Petstep II Multi-Purpose Dog Sately Ramp was perfect for getting my black Lab, Blake, out of the water and over our sea wall.  He is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight.  He is very appreciative and so am I!

I would highly recommend this product and the seller selling it."	1

"The 5star Convenience of Kitchen Aid Mixer
	I hav K5SS model of the Kitchen Aid Mixer and it has worked well for me when I do my cookies, cakes or mix ground meat for meat loaf. It is very easy and convenient to use. 
Basically, I would want to inquire about other attachments for this model and how and where can I get them. I am from the Philippines. I am interested to purchase attachements like a sausage stuffer, grinder. Sorry for using this site, as I am lost where to get in touch with ""Kitchen Aid Inc"". thanks and please email me"	1
"nearly perfect
	This tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break.  I'm hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival.  I've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea.  But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.

The ONLY down side is that the cap won't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out.  But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass."	1
"Perfect measurers!
	I have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best!  Heavy (but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend (or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away (they are engraved).  I love my set...will definately buy another set (cooking is my hobby)"	1
"Great item
	Boy, do I LOVE this piece! I got mine for a LOT less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful. I LOVE the purple color - it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table. It does wonderfully in the oven - it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so.  It's about 1.5 quarts.  I get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple, well, it's just original and if you're afraid of it, don't be. It's just a gorgeous color and one that I'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen. I'm getting more! Highly recommended piece."	1

"A reply about pan dimensions
	I just ADORE silicone bakeware!!!

I don't own this particular pan, but I'm replying to the first review. This pan, according to the description, measures 17-4/5 by 7  and  4/5 by 2 inches. I'd imagine that the individual loaves would probably measure approximately 8 by 3  and  1/2 inches, a good size for, for instance, zucchini bread loaves intended as Christmas gifts"	1
"Best burgers ever
	First thing we cooked in this pan were burgers, and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried.  The raised ridges really carmelize the meat, and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy.  We have prepared chicken, pork chops and fish, and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled.  I would give this pan 10 stars if I could"	1
"Tender at LAST!
	I'm blown away! With 48 blades, this product really does the job quickly and quietly.  No more BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! echoing off the walls which only produced a flat but still tough piece of meat.  I'd gladly pay twice the cost for the Deni because it works!  It's very sturdy, very sharp and easy to clean in the DW.  I'm using cheaper cuts of meat sucessfully in recipes I had stored away because of toughness or price.  Marinating is faster and more effective, cooking time can be reduced.  Keep it away from kids.  Protect your countertop.  The best kitchen gadget I ever bought!!"	1
"Excellent Food Processor/Blender Combo!
	I have used different brands of Blenders and Food Processors from various manufacturers in the past, but beleive me or not, this Blender/Food Processor is really the one I am looking for. It has a powerful motor that can easily break ice, plus the Blender jar is made of really thick, unbreakable material, unlike many other Glass Blender jars. One other feature I like about this combo is its wave action technology, which can continuously pull down the mixture in it and this system really works. The Food processor is large enough to chop/mix fruits and vegetables, and above all it saves a lots of space in my kitchen. I have read a lots of bad reviews from many people about other Combos like this, but I don't know what these people are exactly trying to do with a Blender/Food Processor."	1
"Best purchase I have made
	We love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.  We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear.  With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing."	1

"Perfect, every time
	This machine turns coffee into a near-religeous experience!  Every cup has a perfect crema head, is absolutely fresh, piping hot, rich and strong - and it's SO fast!

Anyone who doesn't like this coffee maker has to be: 

1)  Using the machine incorrectly (most of the criticisms I've read reveal the real culprit is ""pilot error"")  
2)  Using bad coffee, or
3)  Just not a coffee lover!

I have been responsible for the sale of at least 25 of these machines, simply by serving its coffee to family, friends and collegues - everyone rushes out to buy one for themselves.  (Granted, I use great coffee:  Java One's French Roast.  Look for a retailer on-line.)  

My friends have abandoned Starbacks, now that they can make this!  So don't let the critics scare you - this is the BEST thing to happen to coffee since the blessed bean was discovered.  

Come over - I'll make you a cup and all arguments will be settled"	1
"A very satisfactory purchase

"Excellent Little Heater
	I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price.  I expected it to get me through that winter only.  I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer.  It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter.  The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose.  Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated.  The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately.  I'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough.  I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails.  A good, solid product for a very good price"	1

"Nice Set, BUT....
	I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well. Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit.

Keep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel, but the lighter weight ALUMINUM. You will NOT be able to mistreat
these pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will cause
the pans to warp.

The advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easy
to handle. I definitely recommend them.
 
As with all TEFLON coated pans, be sure to use the PLASTIC
utensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you will
ruin the Teflon surface. With a little care these will last for
years!

TIP: If you're having trouble with the bottom of your pots and
pans getting a scorched or burnt look, it's from GREASE. When
you wash your pans, make sure all the grease is cleaned off of
the outside bottom of the pans"	1
"engineer, not a baker
	I bought one of these muffin pans because I was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn't destroyed by the 3rd time I wanted to use it. For that alone, I would give this item 5 stars.

I am not an experienced baker, but I think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan.

So here are my comments:

1. You need to use a cookie sheet (or something similar) to support the pan since it is flexible.

2. The muffins cook faster than with a metal pan.

3. The muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan - you can actually fill them up all the way. (Recall that I am not an experienced baker; as an engineer I suspect that since the muffins cook differently, i.e. faster, this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner. As far I'm concerned as long as the muffins taste good, it doesn't matter to me.)

4. The coating is not exactly non-stick. You do not need to grease the pan, but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins. I use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan (while gently pulling the pan). After doing that I put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as I invert the pan. All I have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out. By my third time doing this I was able to get them all out intact and unscathed.

I am very happy with my muffin pan - it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans - but for me, the benefit of not having a cheap non-stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use"	1
"Squeezes out the competition
	I bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much. 

The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is ""multifunctional""--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work. 

So, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are:

1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing.
2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. 
3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle.
4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor.
5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing.
6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.

Now it's ready to start juicing.  
 
1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 

2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this.

3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve (cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor. 

4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful.

5. Cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again.

The Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage.  We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it. 

Just for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind--not something you'd use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta. 

How does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing?

1. The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender.  

2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale.

3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier.

In summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price"	1
"Very good machine...enjoy the quietness
	I've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly"	1
"The New Kitchen
	The solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use.  We didn't want high maint. type of cookware just a high quality, easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day.  Boy we are impressed! These cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid. They are easy to clean and a dream to handle"	1
"Great Sheets!
	I was originally looking for silk sheets but not the silk sheet price tag.  I'm SO glad I bought these sheets instead.  They are comfy, warm and very smooth to the touch.  They fit my 14"" mattress with ease.  I've had them about 2 months now and there are only a few drawbacks that I've noticed... they take _forever_ to dry in my dryer and they might need ironing once dry'ish.  Overall, not worth 600 but if you can catch them on sale you'll be very pleased with the results"	1

Just be sure that your guests do not walk off with them, or even worse toss them in the trash when they are done with their drink."	1

"Pretty,Stylish,Scratches and Chips
	To prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta's smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates (cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware (Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don't put my original pieces in my microwave, (only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups  and  plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and ""cheap""- looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color (like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too."	1
"Great knife for the price
	I received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku (which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife."	1

"Nice and Roomy!
	This steamer fits perfectly on Cuisinart's 4 Qt saucepan.  The lid seals in every bit of steam.  I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn-on-the-cob, but since no steam escapes here, I can make several batches non-stop.  I also like the fact that the steamer is wide; that means that the food will cook evenly (instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked).  I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.  Washing it immediately will keep it stain-free.  Overall, an incredible deal for $20.00"	1

Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter"	1
"Very Solid
	This is a wonderfully efficient zesting tool. If you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product. It boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting. Very easy to hold and twist when zesting. It even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling. This beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife. (As I did for years before I learned better) I use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and I see no signs that this tool will dull, break, or wear out anytime soon. Highly recommended tool for any active zester. As easy to wash as a fork. Cool"	1
"Beauty and Function
	This roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment. It is heavy duty and I have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey.  It is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting; the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast I could fit in my oven.  It washes clean with little effort so I have not had to use the dishwasher.  It looks like new after washing.  This pan will be around a lot longer than I will!"	1

	Nordic Ware makes the best looking pans, but this is my favorite pan from Nordic Ware!  This pan makes beautiful breads and cakes.  Because it has a  non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher  setting when baking.  And even though it is non-stick, I suggest that you  spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick!  It's also  very easy to clean up"	1

"Nice Pans
	I've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well. They say not to put them in the dishwasher but I have and the non-stick is holding up fine. The lids fit nice and tight and the handles don't get too hot - unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven, in that case the handle will be HOT.
All said I definately recommend these cause:
1.  There is just the right pans for most situations - who really needs 15 pans?
2.  You get good quality for the money.
3.  The non-stick is terrific"	1

	Took a few minutes to get the hang of using the rolling pin, after that it became a piece of cake.  I love the length, weight and now it is the only rolling pin that I use"	1
"LOVE this!!!
	I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking. Seems powerful enough for everything I have tried it on.

"Surprisingly good kitchen shears
	I used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself, so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands. In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top-quality, reasonably priced set of kitchen shears"	1
"Cuisinart is short-sighted
	I love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company"	1
"Excellent knife set, highly recommend!
	If you prep a lot of fruits and vegetables in your kitchen, this is the set for you.

The Santoku knife is lighter than a standard chef's knife.  But this is what makes it so wonderful on fruits and vegetables.  I have used it to carve prime rib (just to see how if worked) and it performed just as well as my chef's knife, except that it is a little smaller.

I find that I use the Santoku 90% of the time in my kitchen.  If you are diminutive female, this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef's knife.  I love the blade on this knife.  It holds an edge much longer than my non-Wustof knives.

The paring knife is nothing special.  But it does have the same nice hard blade that is on the Santoku.

You will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love to cook."	1

"A Bar Favourite!
	Tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it?  The vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we've tried.  The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback (very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you're measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper"	1

"Very functional
	I like these lid covers as they fit very well.  I have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking, or aluminum foil tearing.  I would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them.  I also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator"	1
"KitchenAid always has what you need...
	There isn't much you say about a plasic cover, but I'll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you're mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware (spelling?)  item.  I'd recomend having them around, because you'll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe"	1
"5 Stars for the price!
	I bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago  and  they have actually become my favorite sheets.  I have several sets, and many of them were quite exepensive, but i always seem to reach for these sheets.  The only time we use another set is when we are washing these.  They are very soft  and  stretchy (not too stretchy)and wash up so nice(they hold the dryer warmth so well)!  This set has been great during the summer  and  i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket.  You couldn't get a better set anywhere near this price!"	1
"Great Every Day
	This thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible."	1
"Great, but buy elsewhere
	The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. 

At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer"	1
"powerful machine
	After years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender, and having to stop and stir, and stop and stir, and worry about burning out the motor, we now don't have to worry any more. Even when ALL of the fruit we add is frozen, this machine grinds, chops, and smooths with impressive power. It's fairly easy to clean, provided you don't wait for days, and has a handy pouring valve thing. A few recipes are included"	1
"Good measuring cup
	After reading some of the reviews, I was somewhat reluctant to buy this product, but it went on sale at $3.99, and I decided to risk it.

It measures up the the quality and function of most Oxo products.  The measurements on the side and inside are completely accurate, which is different from what some have described.

I like the cup better than my pyrex ones for dry and cold liquid products, but being plastic, it cannot be used for hot products that contain grease or oil.  The handle is ergonomically designed and is easy to scoop flour, sugar, beans, or other bulk products.

The only negative is that you have to have another measuring cup for hot, greasy products"	1
"great set of knives
	I've never had a ""nice"" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart  and  Final come apart for easy washing and drying"	1
"Large and plush
	I ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They're larger than I expected and very plush.

"Don't put it in the freezer and the blade assembly won't break
	Enough said.

DON'T PUT A FROZEN JAR ON THE BASE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY.  I am sure the owners manual says that someplace.

My Kitchen Aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after I purchased it.  Aren't you glad you could purchase the replacement part?

My story:  My son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer, jar and all.  The next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the Kitchen Aid blender, the motor broke the blade assembly.  The motor base was still good and I liked the blender.  Kitchen Aid changed their model and didn't make replacement parts.  I think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months.  (...)!

I can't say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my Cuisinart blender.  The jar's shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar.  The jar's size is larger than any I have found.  I pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout (which I concede is a little wide).  The weight keeps the blender in place.  The shipping weight is around 15 LBS is that too heavy?  Maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink.  Most every quality blender has weight to it.  The plastic units are light and considered disposable.  Keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want, however I'll keep my Cuisinart!

The three year warranty and Cuisinart's backing keep us, the consumer, in parts when we do something stupid (like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly).  (...) replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being FORCED to purchase a new blender (Kitchen Aid).

Buy the Cuisinart a great value for a quality product."	1
"Outstanding knife set!

"Microwave Egg Boiler
	It works great, and it's small (6"" high, 5"" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).

It does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel. I place the whole thing under the cold tap, then remove the top, and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling"	1
"big and useful
	Initially I was very surprised by how large the tools were. They are much bigger than any tool I've bought previously. If you don't have much space in the kitchen, I'd think twice about buying these tools.  However, after using them I think they are quite sturdy and useful.  Eventhough they are large, they are not heavy and sometimes there size is quite helpful.  You can pick up a whole fried egg with the spatula, for example. I am happy with my purchace, because the price was good"	1
"Very Nicely-Built Aebleskiver Pan
	I've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no-name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago.  It is very well broken in with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents.  I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies!  

Therefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try.  I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it's temperature nicely.  The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that.  I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non-stick surfaces as my old pan (no, it's not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use.

By the way, I've found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them.  I'm sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I'll describe the one that I've settled on, because it is so easy:

Heat the pan at a medium-low setting.  Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix (I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits.  Don't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it.  Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent (If you're new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.)  I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent.  After about a minute, I use a knitting needle (or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn.  I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up.  I keep turning them with a spoon until they're done.  (You'll just have to break one of them open to check, because it's dependent on your batter and temperature.)

Once you get it down (usually after a few rejects), serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar.  Once you eat them, you'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball!"	1
"1/2 Toaster, 1/2 Oven
	Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black  and  Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B and D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).  

I looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T-Fal.  The less expensive ones ($25-$40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk.  Not worth the chance.  I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option.  

The T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon  and  it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B and D.  No big deal - wrong.  It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B and D.  Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open.  This because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches.  I can open the top, but I need to hold it open.  My fault, not the product or mfr.  But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen.

The function buttons are very simple, nothing complicated - one button for toast, one for bake, another for broil.  You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps (electronically) three times when it shuts off.  There is a clock, but it could be easier to set.  

I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy).  The toast function takes longer than the old B and D (about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me.  The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small.

Clean-up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray, glass doors and non-stick surfaces.

Negatives: you can pull the rack out about 30-40 percent before it tips forward and burns you.  It's controllable, not a big deal, unless you don't know about it.  I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it.  
The fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B and D has no fan).  But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking.

Overall, it's a well built, well-designed machine."	1

"We made not only the right choice but the Best Choice!
	For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.  

We enjoy ""Sweet-Tea"" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it's hot at the time of brewing.  Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed.  Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every-time.  If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret.  Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker.  I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it's totally worth it"	1
"works good

"Feels like home
	My mother is Korean and so I grew up using stainless steel chopsticks.  Apparently they're quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?

Anyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks (like the noodle comment made earlier) but it's not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles (which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.  Trust me...it all goes where it needs to.  

The main thing is getting use to their diameter.  These are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants.  Not for the novice chopsticker"	1

Its to the point that I don't even have the other ones out anymore.  I am here looking to replace my original set of 3 (2 mits + 1 potholder) and I was surprised by the negative reviews.  So surprised in fact that I am writing this review.  I swear by them"	1

"Inexpensive pump machine that really delivers GREAT espresso
	The feature's on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions! 
I highly recommend this one! Enjoy"	1
"Great design, great function
	I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh. 

I read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug"	1

"A great starter piece or addition to your Le Creuset collection
	Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. 

Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. However, there are exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so are these cooking vessels. 

Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain your cooking vessel. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. 

The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the buffet casserole specifically. The buffet casseroles are one of the most versatile pieces in the Le Creuset lineup.  Use this pan as a saut� pan, a roasting pan, for poaching, or as a shallow braiser.  The 3.5 quart capacity can is plenty of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The buffet casserole tends to do best if at least three quarters full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the evenly dispersed heat in the pot. 

With a large flat bottom that curves up this pan resembles a curved sided saute pan the only thing missing would be a long handle. The tight fitting lid is mostly flat with curved sides. This lid seals in heat, moisture, and flavors and can be used to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan. 

I tend to use this pot for basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else. But once you get past the basic functionality that lends itself to recipes such as paella, frittatas, deep dish pizza, and casseroles, you can really open up the possibilities.  Keep in mind this is a 3.5 quart pan, feeding two out if it is ridiculous unless you want leftovers. It is probably the perfect size for a family of four in most cases.  Try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding for when you need to please many guests, poaching fish, or Mac and Cheese. The possibilities almost seem endless. 

One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.
PROS: 
Extremely versatile 
Efficient absorption and distribution of heat 
Hygienic enamel cooking surface 
Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors 
Easy to clean when not abused or misused 
Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table 
Can easily last a lifetime 

CONS: 
Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 12.25 pounds"	1
"The most useful thing
	I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.

Few things of note:

* Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week.

* You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates.  Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance.

* Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz (such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc).  The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly.

* It's better to keep the bottle upright so there's no pressure on the rubber stopper (It does not need to stay moist like a cork).

Its purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well"	1

I purchased two matching cups at the same time and they remind me of Russian tea glasses---a collecting favorite of mine. I highly recommend this all-around good buy"	1
"NEVER put a carbon steel knife into the dishwasher!
	Lisa S from Ohio complains that the knives rust very easily and that this is a buyer-beware item.  This is not a buyer beware item. This is an item that requires some knowledge about use and care of carbon steel knives. Carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general. It does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing, and even wiped with a little olive oil. These knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater, and they should never be run through a dishwasher. If you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher, buy cheap stainless steel ones"	1
"A good little fan.
	This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.
All in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you"	1

"cast iron convert
	i was looking for a non non-stick surface griddle to cook pancakes on and i got so much more.  my husband and i are concerned about the effects of dupont coatings on our children's long term health (he is a doctor) so i have been searching for a stainless griddle for ages. finally, i happened upon cast iron as an option.  i never really understood the benefits of cast iron and it seemed so high maintenance -- all the seasoning involved.  i was also reluctant to use it because you are not supposed to really scrub it clean which goes against my personality.  plus, where would i store my seasoned not so clean griddle when i was not using it.  well, the thing is ... when am i not using it? (and when i am not i store it in my oven)  i use it almost every day.  the grill side works great for bacon, salmon, hamburgers, chicken--anything when i don't feel like firing up the grill.  so far everything turns out perfect, not too dry.  the griddle side is great for pancakes and eggs and truly non-stick without the chemicals of a coating to worry about.  The bottom line is...I love this product more than any other kitchen item since my kitchen aid mixer (another love of mine).  i plan to buy more as gifts for all my family and friends with gas stoves (I am not sure how well it works with electric eyes).  truly a kitchen basic.  if you are thinking of getting one, you should"	1
"Most durable steel I've seen
	Got this as part of a wedding gift and couldn't believe how strong and sturdy this is.  I imagined if it fell out of the window of my kitchen into the street from the 2nd floor that it'd have a tiny scratch.  It's a fine container, nice looking, and I'm glad I got it"	1
"Cusinart Griddler
	The cuisinart griddler has proved to be a very handy appliance in my kitchen. It's various heat settings which are accurate is very helpful in perfect results for various tasks.  We have become addicted to panini!  They come out perfectly.  Steaks are done to perfection! I have not used the griddle as much, but when I have the results are great."	1
"the best mug ever!
	You are going to LOVE this mug.  I bought it in the curry yellow, and ended up buying three more. The finish is beautiful and the shape fits your hand so well.  It is like satin as you hold it and it keeps your tea warm and wonderful.  The lip is perfect and not too thick.  Buy one and see!! Chantal products are the best.  Check out their soup bowls"	1
"Easy to handle
	I like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers.  This is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design.  It would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir.

Works great on the flat top range and cleans up nicely.

Highly recommend, but it seems to be out of stock often"	1
"works like a charm
	ive had only great hot drinks from my machine!! i love it"	1
"Quality Gadget

"Good oven - beware warranty pitfalls...
	We had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut.  I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd.  So I called Cuisinart for warranty service.  They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks.  In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem!  So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out.  Hmmmm.  

Anyway, we're enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day.  It is slower than a regular toaster, but cooks four pieces of toast/waffles all at once, so I figure its a fair trade.  It does a nice job with open-faced sandwiches or chicken nuggets for the kids on the broiler pan, without having to heat up our full-sized oven.  A practical choice especially for families with kids"	1
"Best Coffee Ever!
	I have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit (for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water (American coffee) or less for stronger coffee (e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee -- it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.

A final bonus to the toddy maker: used coffee grounds are a folk remedy for fire ants. If you have them and you want them gone without throwing a bunch of chemicals in your garden. Put these atop their nest (but watch yourself!). They leave pretty quick."	1
"Mango Splitter
	What a delightful gadget - works as advertised (how unusual)!  Creates nice slices of mango without the mess and without ending up with all the small slivers of fruit you normally get.  Love it"	1
"Sturdy, high quality
	These are well-made spoons, not junky at all, which is always a possibility with cheap, mail-order items of this type.  The steel is heavy-gauge, and all the edges are rounded and safe.  Good value and a good way to  and quot;top up and quot; an order"	1
"Great little steamer; this HS900 model is only $19.99 at Target
	This little unit is very versatile, you can use it to steam anything"	1
"Does the job
	A fork is a fork, right?  This does what you'd expect.  The All Clad difference is that it is beautiful and because it's stainless, it's a very hefty knife.  I think with will hold a large heavy cut of meat well.  I use mine for chicken.  Sparkles when you put it in the diswasher"	1
