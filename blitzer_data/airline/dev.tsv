I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.	0
Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.	0
A3600 14/10/2014 Athens to London and return 22/10/2014 A3603. Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.	0
When I arrived to Brussels airport I had pre-booked my seat a week beforehand. There was a problem with the system and my seat was given away to someone else. I asked then for a window seat and this was not given. I was seated in the centre of the plane in an aisle seat so I had no view of the scenery as we were departing and landing. The cabin crew were friendly. I had pre-booked a hot meal leek and cheddar quiche which was forgotten.	0
Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior. It is a pity.	0
Flew London Heathrow - Athens and back. Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.	0
I flew from Barcelona to Athens and from Athens to Istanbul. I had a booking through United Airlines from Houston originally travelling through Barcelona Athens Istanbul and back to Houston. However at Barcelona Airport I was informed that I had to pay 45 Euro for my baggage for the Aegean flight to Athens. The stewardess were generally rude and spoke little English on board. I will never fly them again.	0
Flight was from Toronto to Dublin. Seats were small and cramped. Drinks took forever to be served and were chargeable (on a transatlantic flight). Crew were very pleasant but there weren't enough of them and service was slow and poor. Food quality was poor - army standards. I am sure there are better airlines doing a better job - WestJet or Air Canada.	0
I travelled business class from Orlando to Dublin. The seats do not recline fully and you are in close proximity to your seatmate. The food is coach class. Do not sit in first row as the attendants go in and out of galley but always fail to close the curtain when they go in and out. Returning to Florida and had to go through JFK and connect to JetBlue who does not have business class so you are in the way back in coach . You can pay extra for a seat closer to the front with extra leg room but of course Aer Lingus does not arrange that. Basically paying for 3/4 business class.	0
Having read favourable reviews of this airline I had been looking forward to my flight from Athens to LHR. The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.	0
MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.	0
Just had a recent experience pre flight. I booked a flight in February for a trip May 21-25 from DFW to PVR. Received an email from my booking site (Rovia) giving me details. From that point to the time of the trip I constantly checked Aeromexico's website for the flight info and it told me that I can't check it until 24 hours before the flight is set to depart. I check it when that time comes and the flight has been rescheduled and conflicted with my connecting flight in Mexico City (both Arrival and departure). This was done without any email notice or anything. There was no attempt to fix the mess up with the exception of giving me a flight in days later and flight out many more days after my trip. This was to be my first trip out of the country and this airline ruined it so I am completely unsatisfied and will definitely recommend anyone doing business with Aeromexico.	0
We flew Aer Lingus for our trip to Europe. We are a family of 4 with extensive travel experience. The tickets were not very cheap to begin with. We wanted to fly into London and fly out of Paris. For this the fare difference between Aer Lingus and Virgin British Airways was about $25-40 per person. Having flown with them I have now decided it would have been better to have flown with BA or Virgin. The flight from SFO to DUB and back is a long haul flight. On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond. From time to time it hangs and we had to ask the crew to reboot the system. I guess we have been used to superior service from BA Singapore Airlines Cathay Air New Zealand and were disappointed even though the difference pricewise was not much. Speaking for myself and family we will not fly Aer Lingus again even if they offer a cheaper price.	0
AM 669 from SFO to Mexico City in Clase Premier / Business Class on January 23 2015. The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing. Aeromexico should be ashamed of themselves for treating their Business Class passengers this way.	0
Buenos Aires to Miami with a delay in the output of Buenos Aires 5hrs. After a scheduled stopover in Santa Cruz in Bolivia suffered a further delay of 4 hours. In addition to this as the plane that took us up was very small for the flight he was forced to make an additional stop to fuel in Cali Colombia. The planes we had to take us to get to Miami were dirty with broken seats no kind of entertainment (such as TV). The poor and inattentive staff of course had to deal with few resources. The return flight similar. Delays old planes but most of the journey by plane Miami-Santa Cruz had a noise in your engine that was intolerable to the ears. Large number of passengers frightened by the strange sound was heard constantly.	0
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil - a saving of about $50US over GOL. At the airport check-in was easy. I recommend that you arrive early to avoid the impending line. The counter staff was as friendly and they did not charge me for my extra luggage weight. I was impressed by the 737 that AeroSur is using on this international flight [do note that most AeroSur flights use aging 727s]. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on this two hours flight and we arrived on time. .	0
I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.	0
"I fly from Bangkok to Copenhagen transit at Moscow then same route on my way back. On my way back to Thailand which is just 2 days ago on SU270 I was not impressed with the cabin crew at all. Their service was not helpful. While they were serving dinner I asked for something to drink the crew member just said ""one minute"". At that time I thought that they were busy serving food so I waited I ended up having to eat my whole meal without any drink! I myself would not fly with this airline again."	0
A3650 ATH-FCO 28th May 2013. One of the crew had a very bad attitude. She never smiled and just dropped the food in front of me in a very rude way without saying anything. Secondly pre-landing I was using an earphone with the music off. She told me to turn it off which I had done. However I still needed to put the earphones on my ear for descent due to discomfort in my ear during that flight. When she saw me still using the earphones she told me again when I said it was already off and she kept telling me in a rude way to turn it off. She refused to check and kept asking me to put down my earphones.	0
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil. At the airport check-in was easy. It pays to arrive early and avoid the impending line. The counter staff was friendly and they did not charge me for my extra weight (about 4 kilos). I was impressed by the new 737 that Aerosur used on this leg - most AeroSur flights use older 727. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on a 2 hours flight and we arrived on time. I would use them again for this route.	0
I bought the ticket in February to travel to Kinshasa in April - in March all flights were cancelled because of the conflict in Libya. I went to the travel agency to ask about what I should do - the answer was to wait until the end of the conflict. Agency was unable to rebook me or to transfer to other airlines. I am having difficulties to find their offices in London or contacts - can someone help. I have lost my money and time and no one to help.	0
Arrived at the airport at 4.30am supposed to fly to Sydney at 8.30am had a connecting flight to Melbourne from Sydney. Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!	0
Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport. I will never fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.	0
"In June 2009 I booked a trip from London to Cape Town (via Tripoli) with Afriqiyah Airways leaving on Christmas day for about £400 - a pretty good deal. However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up ""a few passengers"" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay £200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets. Despite the lovely planes this was the worst airline experience I have had."	0
I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.	0
We bought this ticket to fly from Sao Paulo to Sydney everything went wrong from the beginning. Our flight was delayed 10 hours on the way to Sydney and on the way back they cancelled the flight. After 9 hours we were sent to a hotel near the airport no employee of the Airline anywhere. Bought a new ticket from Lan airlines.	0
Flew Barcelona-Toronto via Dublin. First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.	0
"Today I was scheduled to fly from Mexico City to LAX but I was connecting from another city. Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was ""weather problems"" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost."	0
"LHR-BOS via DUB. They held the flight to DUB in order to fill all unsold seats which made us late for the plane to BOS. They had us run all over the airport 3 times and sent us to 4 different wrong desks staff were rude and patronising they did not listen to anything we said just printed new boarding passes and left us to waste 5 hours in DUB airport with no meal vouchers or anything. Seats were ""downgraded"" to much worse ones in the back plane flight attendance slept for most of the flight and I had to wait 20 mins to get some water to take some headache pills. Even worse on the way back we had to make a transatlantic flight in such a tiny plane that ""low cost airlines"" would have been ashamed of! And all in hellishly hot temperatures."	0
I did some flights with Aigle Azur on Paris - Hassi Messaoud route (Algeria for those who are not familiar). This flight has only one type of customer: oil  gas people. I have found the service as fair overall crew friendliness and meals are actually in good category (crew friendlier then Air France). It's a pity Aigle Azur does not have baggage transfer handling agreement at CDG which means that each time we transit at CDG to / from other airlines we need to go through the immigration to recover our luggage no automatic transfer between Aigle Azur and other airlines at CDG (leading to LOSS of luggage at CDG for those not in the know such as in my case). I hope they could one day operate inside Algeria (the company owner is Algerian - French) since with the local monopoly by Air Algerie the service is non existent.	0
Afriqiyah Airways customer service is non-existent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage - I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.	0
Sydney to Buenos Aires then to Santiago and return. Flying to and from Sydney the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour. Real disappointment for a holiday I had waited 1 year for.	0
A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.	0
On September 7 2013 300 hundred people with small children were kept for 4 hours in Sheremetevo because the aircraft and crew were waiting the group of transit passengers. (Flight SU 0102). It was the difficult long flight to New York - 9.5 hours plus 4 hours delay. Many passengers among these 300 hundred people lost their connections. It is shameful. My seat was between two large men and it was very uncomfortable I had only a half seat for myself. I will avoid Aeroflot flights since this event.	0
ATL-MEX-ATL in addition to my earlier review I want to add the 2nd part of worst experience I had. Redeeming my skymiles I booked ATL-MEX a new ticket as Aeromexico was not willing to rebook me. At the end of my business trip in MEX I tried to check in for my return flight but I learnt that they have an internal policy that if you are not on your first flight they cancel your booking for the second flight. To get home I had to buy another ticket. The SkyTeam should really choose their codeshare partners more wisely. Never again.	0
Dublin to Cardiff on Friday 27 Dec. Stormy day but no information as to when flight would depart. Left waiting in very cold room in bowels of the airport for 2 hours. Flight took off just over 2 hours late but disappointingly pilot never told us they had not taken our baggage due to weight restrictions. At Cardiff everybody stood around the baggage carousel and no bags. Rang Dublin to find out when bags would arrive and found no info. Told case was still in Dublin and as we were due home on Sunday 29th December to go to the baggage counter in arrivals. On Sunday at 1pm I got a call from Cardiff Airport to say my case had arrived and as we were flying home that evening they would hold it at the airport. Like previous comments I like to support The Irish Airline but my confidence in them has been shattered and a good weekend was destroyed.	0
EI 178 Dublin-London. Thoroughly agree with previous reviewer. Lack of information was very frustrating and unhelpful. Despite the delay luggage also did not make it out of Dublin so it is missing somewhere in the world now. Missed transfer to Sydney and no provisions were put in place for those who missed their flights. As an Irish person living abroad who wants to be proud of their national airline I was very disappointed with the experience I had.	0
Mexico City to Cancun in Business Class. Lounge in T2 is ok. Flight attendant wasn't very friendly. Only drinks and no food served on the 2.15 hr flight to Cancun. Very poor service. Seat was ok. No entertainment.	0
My husband and I were so excited for our honeymoon. We left LAX on July 21 2013 destination ZLO. The way there wasn't too bad. On our trip back on Aug 3rd we had a 5 hour layover in Mexico City. Numerous flights were cancelled throughout the day and we ended up staying at the airport for over 12 hours until the cancelled everything altogether. We were put up in a hotel nearby which had a 1.5 hour wait to check in due to everyone else's flight being cancelled. We slept for 2 hours and had our departure to LAX early AM. We finally arrived in LAX and Aeromexico lost my husbands baggage. All we wanted to do was go home and we were stuck waiting for an Aeromexico staff for at least an hour so we could give them our contact information and leave. That was the worst trip back ever.	0
I arrived to the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before my scheduled departure time. I was told that there was a 3 hour mandatory check in time. The agents involved did not want to hear about my issues on my way to the airport. I was told that especially on Sundays flights are full up and my seat was sold to another customer. I had no bags to check in and I had to pay a hefty fine to re-schedule my flight to another day. For all those unfamiliar with the DF airport it takes 10 minutes to go through security and another 5 to walk to the gates. Most flights are not even given a gate number until 1 hour before the scheduled departure time. This was my fist and last time flying with Aeromexico.	0
I have never encountered an airline where the passengers themselves have to collect the luggage from the runway! This happened to me thrice with Air Algerie: Lyon to Constantine 2002 Lyon to Annaba 2004 and Constantine to Paris 2005. I am afraid Air Algerie had a lot to learn to be internationally competent.	0
Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!)	0
"Belfast to Larnaca 18th May at 23.40pm. The food was shocking and the staff rude and unhelpful. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meals unless it was water. The toilet doors at the front were locked and out of order. One lady asked about her booked meal - the air hostess replied ""no booked meals tonight"" shrugged her shoulders and walked on. On the way home however Larnaca to Belfast it was like a different airline - air hostesses were well presented and couldn't do enough but the food was still shocking. On both flights - no film or inflight entertainment."	0
I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !	0
Flight from Bariloche to Buenos Aires delayed 7 hours because of weather. We had a connection from BA to Iguazu that was missed despite airline staff at Bariloche airily dismissing our concerns. Staff did not communicate. The next day we flew to Iguaza with no food or drinks. Staff were hostile uncaring and rude. Planes are old and not very clean.	0
"Miami to EZE. No online check-in or boarding pass. I had one carry on bag and they tried to make me check it. The plane seemed old the food was ok 2 movies on overhead monitors however my headset didn't work. Attendants were friendly hardly ever saw them except for the 2 ""meals"" no diet coke and no soft drinks available for breakfast. Landed 25 minutes late after a 9 hour flight with the announcement ""another on-time arrival"". Saying it doesn't make it so. I have to return on them but I'll not use them again."	0
Istanbul to Moscow on April 13. The airplane was quite old and of poor standard (eg: there is no seat light no visual display to follow the air blows from the seat and not from above). The crew were not well trained their way of addressing customers was not professional. The food they served as a lunch was well below standard.	0
ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!	0
Booked to fly Sydney to BA 1pm Tuesday it's now Friday and I've made it as far as Auckland. We sat all day at the gate in SYD eventually told flight cancelled due to mechanical problem. After spending 2 nights we left SYD last night only to land in Auckland for 16 hour layover due to crew shortages. No communication other than rumours from hotel staff. Airline had paid for accommodation and meals but very basic. No entertainment onboard other. Due to fly out 10pm tonight. Traveller beware.	0
Moscow to Ho Chi Minh City and back last month (15.03 and 30.03). Both flights were drastically delayed (from Moscow to Vietnam 6 hours and back 12.5 hours). I missed all my connecting flights and lost hotel bookings. Unfortunately Aeroflot didn't give any information about estimated boarding or departure times as well as reasons for the delays. No foods or drinks served in Moscow during 5 hours of waiting! My luggage went to Stockholm Arlanda not to Tallinn as it was confirmed in Sheremetjevo Airport. I am home now and got my luggage but I am really not sure if I will use Aeroflot for future trips.	0
6 hours delay from Auckland to Buenos Aires and 5 hours delay from Buenos Aires to Auckland. Food was not good the seats were uncomfortable and the TV system rubbish. Staff were not friendly with little customer service skills.	0
Will never fly with them again. We missed our Aero Mexico flight to LA through their incompetence and consequently our onward connection to Australia that evening. Ground staff were next to useless and we got the run-around for 4 hours being passed from one supervisor to another with no-one wanting to take responsibility with lots of shrugging of shoulders. We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class. Food and service is basic. I believe they have plans to fly from MEX to LHR shortly. They will have to lift their game to be any competition to existing carriers on that route. We love Mexico but will use another airline in the future.	0
Flew Mexico City to New York and back in December 2012. At the time of booking was told that a baby bassinet and baby food would be provided for my infant. When I called to reconfirm the flight 2 days before travel I was told that Aeromexico did not have bassinets on a 5 hour flight from Mex to NY. Felt tricked as I was not given this information at the time of booking. In-flight entertainment non existent no personal video screens and unclean airplane on the way into JFK. Movie was shown on an overhead screen unfortunately the headphones provided were non functional. The food was horrible and neither me nor my wife ate the food no baby food provided for my infant. The only positive from the flight was that the plane was empty and we could place our baby on the seat between us. It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay. Inflight food was terrible no video screens despite the plane being brand new. No baby food for the infant. Again the only positive for the return flight was that the baby had a seat between us as the flight was empty. Overall a bad experience for us and our infant.	0
PEK-FCO return economy class. The PEK-SVO/SVO-PEK legs were served through old planes no IFE uncomfortable seats ok food. Transit through Sheremetyevo Airport was a bit of a nightmare: it took a long time and staff was not friendly and helpful. The SVO-FCO/FCO-SVO were much better as planes were newer IFE available and staff friendlier.	0
"Flew from Madrid to Mexico City. First off my flight was delayed for reasons that none of the staff at the desk was able to explain. Check in was extremely disorganised and poorly signaled. About 1 hour into 14 hour flight I noticed that my inflight entertainment screen was still off while other passengers' screens were on. Then it turned out that 6 rows did not have working inflight entertainment screens or overhead reading lights. As soon as we let the staff know they told us they would ""reset the system"" and let people at the front of the plane know. About 30 minutes later nothing was working and we asked again what the status was. We were told quite rudely that they were looking into it. Needless to say this carried on for another 3 hours. It became evident that the flight attendants were avoiding our section as we could see them walking around offering water to passengers in the aisle on the other side of the plane quite often. Finally about 4.5 hours into the flight the person sitting next to me asked once more whether they'd managed to see what was wrong with our screens. The flight attendant said ""well obviously it's not working. Didn't you figure that out?"". I can understand that technical problems may arise but that does not mean that paying customers should be treated rudely. I was very happy to finally land in Mexico city after 14 hours of a tortuous flight. I am very hesitant to fly with Aeromexico again if this is the standard of customer service that they have."	0
"Flight 109 Dublin to NYC. Scheduled to leave at 3.30pm still in airport at 6.40 - airline says next announcement is at 7.30. They are quick to charge high fees for overweight baggage but they fail to spend the money to maintain a sufficient number of ready to fly planes. Weather is fine and we are still sitting in the airport. It is now 6.55 and we are still sitting here. It is freezing so we asked for a blanket: they said they would ""organize"" one and never provided it."	0
I recently flew from Sharjah to Beirut. The staff were very friendly and I was given 11A an exit seat so I had a lot of leg room though all the seats seemed to have buckets of space (more than my previous LH economy flight). The pay-food was good value and tasty and we landed in Beirut 30 mins early. The attendants came though the cabin twice with free water. The A320 seemed brand new and was very clean. A great Flight.	0
YUL-MEX one way. Aeromexico is the only airline to have a direct flight from Montreal to Mexico City. 5 hours flight very disappointed being the first time flying with them. The aircraft a 737-800 looked very tired and dirty no personal ICE what am I doing here staff food so so at least the cabin was almost empty so I was able to stretch my legs through the flight to not get bored at all. As usual some people are luckier than others in my case it turned not a nice experience. At least we arrived almost on time.	0
Despite booking two tickets together my pregnant wife and I were given separate seats. On a return flight from Madrid to Mexico city. After asking three staff member there was nothing to do according to them. On board we had asked for special food and again no sign of it. On the way back we called in advance to have a front row seat and staff at the telephone were helpful but while checking in at the airport we found ourselves in a back seat. Again the special meal was nowhere to be seen. In the future I will try to avoid using this company.	0
I fly regularly on the flight Almaty to Beijing and back. I have to say this is a terrible flight. 4-5 hours at night on an A320. There is little difference between business and economy. The support service for booking and upgrades is simply the worst I have experienced.	0
BHD to LHR. Flight on time flew on a modern A319 cabin crew friendly enough however legroom was practically non existant I literally didn't have room to read a magazine on my lap and actually getting to my (window) seat was tough. Overall pretty average but the lack of reasonable legroom made the flight quite uncomfortable.	0
MEX-LAX Dec 2011. Business/First poor boarding seat cramped meal was a bad ham sandwich. Plane was a 737-700 that was late departing. As we approached LAX there was fog and we were told we were going to Tijuana. On arrival at Tijuana passengers told we would be flown back to Mexico City. As a few passengers complained we were eventually let off the plane but told we were 'on our own'. Airline did not care less and said they had no responsibility for the situation. Bags took 30 minutes to show up. The product was bad to start with but the whole experience was just awful. Ended up taking a taxi to San Diego and then having to drive myself to LA.	0
SFO-OAX roundtrip via MEX. Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner. Only highlight of flying AM was that we ended up spending a lot of time at the Salon Premier lounges in T2 which were nice though filled to the gills.	0
LHR-SVO-ULN return. I have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months. This is by far the fastest way to Mongolia from London but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through SVO. The planes from LHR to SVO are generally new and clean. Onward from Moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. The food is always the same - just about edible in business class. Out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. Going to give up with Aeroflot and fly Korean air via Seoul now. Via Moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while.	0
Flight was cancelled from Sydney to Auckland on July 28. I knew this as had checked on internet. However when I tried to ring I got cut off 4 times before finally talking to someone. When we finally got to the airport the boy I was travelling with was 'on the list' but I wasn't and was touch an go as to whether I would get a flight at all. All ended well as we finally both got back to NZ even though we were put on different flights. I felt sorry for the staff in Sydney understaffed and under a lot of stress but they were polite and as helpful as possible.	0
Traveled with Aer lingus in May 2013 from London to Belfast City. Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia. These aircraft are only just bearable for a shorter journey. I also found there to be too many in flight announcements selling food and goods. British Airways is the alternate option on this route and whilst their punctuality is not as good as Aer Lingus - every other feature is.	0
CDG-RUN-CDG in Club Austral (Business) class. October - November 2006. Quick check-in nice lounges (although poor drink and snack selections) at both CDG and RUN. All flights perfectly on time quick delivery of luggage on arrival. Business class seat comfort (old) business class IFE (not on demand) first class service and meals. Overall a very nice product much cheaper than Air France and much better (at least compared to AF current B747 on this route ; new AF product using B777 is expected in 2007). Minor drawbacks : frequent flyer program does not seem on par with AF one ; CDG airport is further from Paris than ORY (which AF uses).	0
During our holiday in Argentina we were unlucky to have several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. They are by far the worst airline I have experienced. It is a very poorly run state owned airline acting like a monopolist. Customers are treated like dirt. Staff at check in is rude (Puerto Iguazu was the only exception). Flights are nearly always delayed without any explanation given or sometimes cancelled altogether. Even worse some of its planes are in very poor condition and seem utterly unsafe. Follow the advice of some Argentinians I met : always avoid them. It is better to spend 24 hours in a bus (they are very comfortable) than 2 hours with Aerolineas.	0
The food was basic but acceptable. Astonished by rudeness of the cabin crew no service at all we were not greeted on the aircraft or off. Crew ignored our need for a glass of water my seat was broken no film or music for a 4 hour flight.	0
"Aeroparque-Montevideo return  4 people at the check-in 2 of them working. The rest doing everything to avoid the customer. Although arriving 2h before departure we almost missed our flight. The queue became so long that locals started fighting with the personnel since they lost their flights due to Aerolineas Argentinas ""I dont care attitude"". Service onboard is a plastic bag with juice and a fruit-bar. Flight attendants friendly. A country like Argentina does deserve a better airline."	0
All planes were hot and stuffy. But their customer service is completely ridiculous. We had 2 checked bags going from Mexico City to Seattle they lost one of them. We reported it missing and then called the next day and they said they had no report and couldn't find the package. They gave us numbers to phones where no one would answer and were completely apathetic. Once they finally found the luggage they then shipped it 5 hours away from our home instead of to the Portland airport which is 15 minutes away. Then they lost the baggage in Yakima! Turns out they shipped it to Canada - still working on getting it back.	0
Booked to fly to Dublin from Birmingham on 18th April on the 14.50 flight. This flight was delayed 5 hours we had no information of any kind during this time. It was not until we got on board and the pilot explained what happened this is very bad practice. It would have been very helpful if we had an announcement just to explain why the plane was late and giving an estimated time of departure. As a result I missed my bus connection and my relatives had to come up to the airport to collect me at 8.30pm.	0
Something is going wrong with this previously reasonable airline. Almaty - Astana flights. The basic route for this airline are notoriously delayed. So if you plan on a business trip on this route make sure to factor in at least a fee hours. Better a day. Disappointing. Ground staff not trained on how to deal with this. As a result they are nervous not pleasant and generally not helpful at all.	0
"March 20th 2015. Flight 7001 from Miami International to Rome via Dusseldorf. The boarding started around 3.15pm. After several hours inside the plane we were informed by the captain that they were trying to fix a ""leak"". After two more hours we were instructed to disembark the aircraft with our carry on and wait inside the terminal. Neither water or any type of food or snacks were offered by Air Berlin employees. Early evening we were told to board the aircraft again with all our belongings to our incredible surprise we stayed inside the plane again for more than two hours. Finally the captain informed the passengers that now the aircraft was having computer ""issues"" and we would have to sleep in Miami without any hint as to when the next plane will be ready for us to continue to Dusseldorf. Early next morning I went to Air Berlin counter just to find chaos and indifference to all passengers from the day before. The employees did not know when the next plane will be departing so I run to American Airlines who provided me with connections to Rome."	0
Flight from London to Delhi via Moscow was cancelled on the day of departure. They put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in Moscow rather than a 3 hour one. I requested a Vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. No one at Aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didn't carry any vegetarian meals. I received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice. These two meagre items not only came to more than the amount I had in tokens but required me to pay several Euros too! The level of English of Aeroflot staff is terrible for an international airline.	0
Traveled from Boston to Dublin an 18 December 2012. Flight was very crowded. Lost of crying babies. They didn't turn the lights off all night and it was very uncomfortable. Flight attendants were rude but I guess they were just busy. Difficult to get any service. Miserable trip.	0
"Long delay in departing Almaty bound for KL. Perfect weather although no real excuse given. On boarding more than 2 hours late and by bus from the terminal to the aircraft which caused more delay we sat on the ground for a further 30 mins while a drunken passenger was off-loaded. At least half the flights I have taken with Air Astana have been delayed by hours not just minutes. On-board I asked the cabin crew to see if the connecting flight would be held or if other arrangements needed to be made. Their reply was that 'we will call ground staff and let you know'. The second time was 'we will talk to the captain' the third time was the same answer. On my fourth request I was then told that we have other passengers who are all going to be late. I was travelling on an Air Astana ticket and there was no concern or accountability shown toward this situation. T Arriving in KL with just 10 minutes to spare for the connection on Malaysia Airlines of course we could not board. 767 used on this route is very old although has had some face-lifts. Seats are narrow for business class seats and they are not lay flat they are ""lay on an angle and keep sliding down"" seats. The entertainment system is an IPAD style of portable unit. This only had a choice of three last release movies and at the end of the day there is nowhere to put it where you might consider ergonomically sensible to watch it. I would recommend that you definitely leave a minimum of 5 hours for your connections because they will most likely be late!"	0
LED-SVO. During this one hour journey the crew managed to serve newspapers drinks (with coffee/tea) plus a nice sandwich. New A320 everything went smoothly. Recommend on this busy route between 2 Russian main cities.	0
LHR-Moscow. On arrival asked if possible to have an exit row seat. Was advised of a €45 charge which was then waived which was a nice start. Aircraft then boarded one hour late and one hour taxi/waiting to take off which made it 2 hrs delayed. Cabin crew efficient but poor command of English. Good leg room/comfort with food as expected on an Economy ticket although alcohol has to be paid for.	0
Istanbul-Moscow-Tokyo (Narita) Economy. Was not expecting much when I purchased the cheapest one way ticket I could find. Check-in at Istanbul despite having a 20 mins wait was friendly and easy. Flight to Moscow delayed 30 mins but the cabin interior was clean and brand new if a bit spartan (no inflight entertainment). Still the seats were comfy and the flight attendants courteous. Moscow-Tokyo leg was great. The seats were comfortable flight attendants friendly and everything went smoothly. My only real complaint is that the choices on the inflight entertainment on this leg were slim but at least it was there.	0
JNB-GBE-JNB. Pleasantly surprised with the flights on ATR's considering we were in the middle of RTW FC Oneworld - unfair comparison. Cabin crew were OK certainly as good as I would expect. The aircraft must have had new paint recently as they looked quite good in and out. Didn't expect to be flying them no spare pages in passport so SA wouldn't allow me in country.	0
Johannesburg - Maun Economy Clas BAe-146. On arrival at the airport we engaged the services of a porter. We had 2 rucksacks and 2 camera bags. I paid him around ZAR30 (USD4) and it was well worth it. As we had bought goods in Johannesburg and wanted to claim back tax I told the porter and he zipped us off to a Customs Counter that had no queue (we passed others that had at least 7 people waiting in line). We cleared Customs in no time check in was fast immigration and security had short queues and it took around 15 minutes to get the VAT refund processed. The aircraft was a BAe-146 - load was around 30% so we had 3 seats to ourselves. We were served a drink and a very small sweet roll. Maun airport is a small building with 1 immigration line and a bench where your bags get delivered to. Customs a breeze.	0
Air Berlin takes low cost to the max - we will never fly with them again. 3 of us flew from Heraklion to JFK via Dusseldorf on July 20th. After checking in online the previous evening we arrived at Heraklion airport 2 hours early to drop off our bags. There was no separate bag drop line and we were at the very back of the check in line. AB was trying to check in 350 passengers for 2 flights using only 2 counters Each group would take 10-15 min to be checked in - a total nightmare. By the time we got to the counter it was 10 min past departure time the PA system was calling our names for boarding and we hadn't even started the check-in process. By some miracle we made it onto the plane but our bags didn't. When we got to JFK we filled out the lost bag paperwork and headed home thinking we'd get the bags in a day or two. We finally got 1 bag 5 days later and the other two 8 days later.	0
Amsterdam to Atyrau return – one of the most expensive flights per mile of any routes worldwide by any operator so you might think the flight would be special. Old aircraft substandard in-flight entertainment (the overhead TV monitor in my section not working and others with poor picture from what I could see) cramped full flight 2 of the 3 meal choices not available by the time the meal cart got to me all the wine with the meals gone by half way down the cabin bar service once per flight and grudgingly given using cheap local (to Kazakhstan) versions of spirits mixers and wines by unsmiling cabin crew.	0
Delhi-Barcelona. I could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled. My connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation. Moscow airport contains narrow corridors with duty free shops food must be paid with Russian money. There was free Internet but only in a few places with low wifi signal. Plane food was bland and mediocre. Average service.	0
Gaborone to Johannesburg. Not too bad at all. The Pula lounge in Gaborone although tiny is quite a comfortable spot to relax in before the flight. The ATR42 operated on the route is definitely showing its age and seats are fairly uncomfortable. Snack service consists of peanuts and biltong whereas competitor SA Express provides a full sandwich service on board. Crew were friendly - downside being arrival in Johannesburg - for aircraft to overnight in Johannesburg we were parked on a remote stand a good 10-15 minutes from the terminal building.	0
Flying Air Berlin OLB-TXL. Plane in a good condition and clean. Cabin attendants however very unpleasant and seemed just to wait to finish the job. Sandwich with cheese of very bad quality. Hope not to be in situation to fly them again.	0
Hamburg to Tashkent via Moscow and not impressed with Aeroflot. Plane interior was old and not very clean. Entertainment not existing on both flights. Inflight magazine only in Russian. Food was tasteless and choice of drinks is very limited (one drink on 3-4 hour flight and only choice between orange and tomato-juice and Cola or sprite. No alcoholic drinks served or sold. All in all a very disappointing experience!	0
The service at SVO airport is horrible. I flew to Copenhagen by SAS flight 8700 operated by Aeroflot. The agent wanted to charge me for the excess baggage. I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized. In fact all the personnel there turned out to be so rude and incompetent.	0
This airline made a lot of improvements : new aircraft good crew hot meals - no problem at all during flight.	0
At Beijing we had about 2 hours of delay boarding an aged B767. After another 45 minutes captain said sorry today we do not fly: the plane is broken. By about 0430 in the morning the Aeroflot airport staff said to me that I must spend my night with an unknown other traveller. After having been sent to the miserable hotel at about 1330 next day I was able to leave Beijing to Moscow with a better A332 aircraft. Staff is incompetent and very rude. They just don't know a word of English and if you have a problem it remain a your problem. They have to learn a lot.	0
Kiev-Moscow-JFK. Experienced more of the same disorganization that I saw on my previous flights. I have found that flight attendants to not enforce the rules because they are half the size of their very pushy customers. Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers. Aeroflot tickets are cheap enough to entice me to fly with them again even if the passengers act like a mob.	0
London-Moscow-Bangkok price way cheaper than competitors when we booked planes seemed pretty new decent choice of films music games etc so-so - food. Staff extremely unfriendly no alcohol in economy 3 hours in Moscow. Would always have to be way cheaper than better alternatives such as Thai Etihad Emirates for me to use them again. However much better than Royal Jordanian who we used to BKK last Christmas - they were truly appalling.	0
After a long trip from Sydney-Abu Dhabi and a stop time of 3 hours (+1/2 hour delay) the more than 7 hours flight to Dusseldorf started. After almost 2 hours flying finally the staff offered us a small sandwich (with beef or cheese) and one cup of coffee. Another 2 hours later we got a bottle of water. Doing nothing but trying to sit compressed between my seat and the extreme tilted seat in front of me I really felt hungry. When I asked for another piece of bread I got one and the promise that there would be more served in 20 minutes. Indeed we got food. While collecting the rubbish we were offered a drink coffee? No only cold drinks. Before my experiences with Air Berlin were ok but this last flight was really unpleasant.	0
"My boyfriend and I book a trip to Dublin only to get to the airport and was told the flight was cancelled. The manager said the next flight was the following day at 9.45pm. When passengers started asking to be put on another flight he said there were too many of us he said there was nothing he could do and finally shouted ""I am not going to answer anymore questions the flight is cancelled and that is that"". We cancelled the flight and booked another airline that same day."	0
"For an almost 2 hours flight to Bucharest from Berlin TXL we we're served a 20g pack of potato chips which was described as snack. Every airBerlin flight the ""snacks"" become smaller and smaller but this is too much. That bag of potato chips will cost anywhere less than 1 Euro and I think this becomes towards a customer humiliating. There are always the same unhappy stewardess-faces always looking like they can't wait to finish their shift and go home. Not to mention that at the airport we were sent in an improved Terminal with only two flights very crowded and absolutely no duty free facilities. I am fed up with this airline and I have given up my topbonus card after one year of bad experiences with them. I hope I will never have to travel again with them. The only plus I can give the flight was in time."	0
Wasn't the worst flight I've been on, I'll say that. But when you arrive 2 hours early and your flight gets delayed and you arrive at your destination and they not only forget to put my checked luggage on the plane but half a dozen other peoples luggage on the same flight might I add, is just plain ridiculous! Yes I understand it happens, but not to eight different people on the same flight. I fly a lot and out of all the airlines I fly, this has been the most disappointing! My boyfriend and I checked our bags at the same time and his bag arrived.	0
28th August 2013 from Malaga to Hamburg on a very well maintained 737-800. Journey started with online check-in and a bag drop at Malaga airport. The queue was not orderly and the staff did not police the queue very well at all. The check-in agent who dealt with me seemed indifferent and did not make eye contact with me which was rather rude. Boarding the flight took quite a long time as the flight was full. Far too much hand luggage had been allowed aboard the flight. The cabin crew were not very friendly nor welcoming at all. There was considerable turbulence during this flight and the crew did little to allay the fears and concerns of some of the passengers. A small snack was served as well as a drink. At the end of the flight an overheard monitor displayed the route taken for a few minutes only. There was no goodbye from the crew at the end of the flight. I found the staff very cold on this occasion.	0
As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America. There is nothing left that distinguishes them from their American counterparts. Time to get your act together AC.	0
Air Canada rouge was a disgrace at least on this flight. The aircraft interior was dirty, seats shabby and the state of the toilet was atrocious. The aircraft had been at the gate for long enough to be properly cleaned, so there was no excuse for the lack of cleanliness. Flight attendants completely indifferent throughout the flight. Clearly they were intent on doing the bare minimum. Surely and unsmiling. Very poor standard of grooming, some looked like they had slept in their uniforms. There is no in seat entertainment system. A long flight on Air Canada Rouge would be unbearable. Avoid at all costs.	0
ORD-Dublin return. Very disappointing experience. On the way to Dublin the flight was nowhere near full but when asked if we could book seats together it was deemed an inconvenience. The flight attendants are not attentive and are inconvenienced if you ask to be served anything other than tea or coffee. The gate personnel on this airline were unwilling to make any accommodations. On the return gate check-in personnel were awful. They were unnecessarily stern and would not bend to make a single accommodation.	0
Done all necessary procedure to make sure my girl would get proper assistance as she has special needs. When she got to Toronto, no wheelchair was brought to her even though AC confirmed that she would have her own at the door for the leg at the next terminal. She had to walk to the gate and no one offered help! She has cerebral palsy and walks with difficulty and very slowly. Nobody at AC wondered if the only passenger with a wheelchair had the proper service.	0
Departing Catania Sicily Italy on June 30th we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before scheduled departure time. Massive line for check-in only one woman and one desk checking in 2 flights. No weather nor equipment issue purely bad management and under-staffing. 3 hours in line not a single announcement. By the time we arrived in Dusseldorf our flight (business class) to JFK was long gone. Told the next flight they could get us to Chicago on was the following afternoon - 24 hours later! Told they'd booked us into the airport hotel and they gave us two 10 Euro food vouchers. Flew back to Chicago on Lufthansa/the Star Alliance. Despite business-class having angled seats the food service and punctuality of the flight were flawless. As a lifetime-gold/million-miler on American this experience was sufficient for me to alter my habits and to focus on the Star for my future air- travel needs. Air Berlin's 'service' was utterly lacking.	0
I frequently visit Las Vegas throughout the year, I thought I would give Air Canada Rouge a try. One major problem was that the day I flew there was a fuel service strike so I was delayed for over 4 hours. I frequently check my flight status especially when I leave, throughout that day I had checked at least 4 times. I only found out about it when I was at the check in counter. There was no email, no automated phone call, nothing to notify me. I was stuck waiting for hours doing nothing. When we finally got on the flight all they said was sorry. Nothing more. Not even some form of a minor compensation like refunding the baggage fee or something free on the flight. The seats were cramped, there was significantly less legroom compared to Westjet. No entertainment system whatsoever. It's 2015 and this airline operates like it's 1990 with the design of this plane. The sad part is that they can get away with this because there's absolutely no competition in this industry within Canada. Flight travel should be a stress free situation and the whole time I used this airline was such a inconvenience.	0
I've flown transatlantic on Air Canada twice this year, both less then ideal experiences. For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.	0
I have traveled to Europe many times. This was the worst flight I have been on. The seats were extremely cramped and uncomfortable on an 11 hour flight. The person behind me had their knee in the small of my back. Wine was extra. Service lousy. Entertainment via wifi to your personal tablet with ten year old movies. I got told I couldn't get a extra cup of coffee because we were within an hour of landing.	0
June 16 2013 Venice to Dusseldorf to JFK. Very unorganized in Venice. First told to wait in line 54/55 then it was moved to 5657. There was not enough staff to check us in and people in line were rude and pushy. When we finally boarded we were taken to a bus that they crammed the entire plane into. A mad rush to board. The crew opened both doors which made no sense so again another round of people pushing and ending up on the wrong end of the plane. After everyone was settled we were told that the plane had to be mechanically signed off so had to wait 30 minutes or so. The flight from Dusseldorf to JFK had to be held for us. Impressed with Air Berlin on our outbound flight June 5 from JFK to Dusseldorf to Barcelona but this return flight home left much to be desired.	0
Miami-Berlin. Took flight on a one way basis as return dates were subject to change. I am a top tier AA flier and the addition to Air Berlin gives some good connection options. Aircraft was a new Airbus with standard seat pitch and seat comfort in economy was uncomfortable. The IFE is good with each seat having independent controls and a reasonable selection of movies etc. Unfortunately the selection is via a touch screen buried in your seat back and the Neanderthal behind me felt that instead of lightly touching the screen they had to indent their finger into the screen - constant tap tap into my seat that precluded any chance of sleep. Food average drinks average FA's average. Despite being top tier no way to select seat on line - had to call in advance and their website is poor.	0
"New York to Dusseldorf Koln to Berlin Munich to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to New York in the last 2 weeks. Flights were late which seems out of character for a German airline but landed on time. The seats are extremely close together. I'm 6'4"" (194 cm) and could not sit with my legs forward at all and could not stretch them under the seat either. For the longer flights the entire 8 hour flights my knees and shins were pressed into some part of the seats in front of me. I was on the aisle so every time someone passed by me they bumped my knee shoulder or foot impossible to even relax much less sleep. I'm not overweight at all but these seats could only be comfortable for children. To make it all worse on the trans-oceanic flights the pilots seemed to find every segment of turbulence over the North Atlantic. I think we were bouncing around for at least 50% of the trip. Air Berlin: good prices bad passenger experience."	0
LHR to Phuket. We were worried about travelling with this airline following the reviews on here however our flight to Phuket was on time and food and in flight entertainment was ok. So far so good. Our return journey was a different story. We arrived at Phuket airport to be told we couldn't check in as the AirBerlin plane hadn't arrived or even set off for us. Various options were thrown around including another night in Phuket returning on the next Airberlin flight. After being left in the dark for some time we were then booked on to a Qatar airlines flight which first flew to Kuala Lumpur then to Qatar where we then boarded a flight to Heathrow. In total we were delayed by 8 hours. The manner in which we were left in the dark at Phuket was very worrying and it seems from the reviews below that this is not rare for this airline.	0
Trip from Abu Dhabi to Phuket. The plane is new the overall look is ok entertainment is ok as well (just a few movies and all in English and German). But leg room is ridiculously small the seats are very hard and the food is just ok. Adding to this a very unpleasant crew. I will avoid flying Air Berlin on long distances in the future.	0
"Three flights on Air Canada: first flight was YYJ-YYC - a Bombardier Q400 Propeller Plane. It was surprisingly quiet and smooth for a propeller plane as I sat as far away as possible from the engines at the very last row. Cabin crew acceptable but no food offered on this flight. Next leg: YYC-FRA on an Airbus 330 - cabin crew on this flight were atrocious. Food was literally thrown on passengers tray tables. Serving portions were very small. The food which was offered was disgusting - the tomato pasta dish was extremely unappetizing. And the ""continental breakfast"" was a small piece of cake and a yoghurt shake - it was hardly a snack let alone a breakfast. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal service not to be seen again until before landing in FRA. Final leg: YYZ to YYJ onboard an Airbus 320. Seats uncomfortable - my neck became sore about an hour or so into the flight. Again no complimentary food offered on this five and a half hour flight. Overall Air Canada never ceases to disappoint."	0
LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.	0
We had a May 10 premium economy booking from Athens to Toronto at 13.00 in the afternoon. At 9.30 that morning we received a cryptic message from Air Canada apologizing for the flight disruption. We telephoned Toronto to find out that in actuality it had been cancelled due to 'overcrowded airspace'. We were fortunate enough after two phone calls to be able to rebook through London. It was simply listed as 'delayed' and as we boarded outer London flight at 1.30 it was still listed this way. They were as it tip urns out eventually rolled over to the next day 13.00 flight. This is not right not to have informed us all about the flight being cancelled. I do not think I will attempt a Rouge flight again.	0
Booked XL seats on the flight from Tegel-Miami but the seats was not XL. They were by the door (entrance door and emergency exit) which has a very big bulge on the door with makes the legroom (for your left leg) smaller than an ordinary seat. I asked the steward about this and he was somewhat surprised that the seat was sold as XL. On the way back we ordered XL seat for my son. He got an ordinary seat. On the way back we also booked reserved seating for me and my wife to make sure we did not get bad seats. We got seats by the toilet which were impossible to recline. All together we have paid about 200 euro for nothing.	0
"JFK-TXL-CPH and CPH-DUS-JFK. Inadequate legroom for a 5'9"" tall person meant my knees touched the seat in front of me on the overnight to Berlin from JFK. On the way back from Dusseldorf a 6'1"" guy sitting next to me couldn't fit in his seat without sitting bowlegged and the elderly woman in front of him couldn't recline. Aside from the DUS-JFK meals which included various unidentifiable items and cold chicken nuggets other amenities were fine but I will never fly them long haul again. On a positive note domestic European transfers had more legroom than the transatlantic flights."	0
Flight got cancelled and still waiting refund from this airline (4 weeks waiting without even a short answer). Customer Care-Center hasn't got a telephone number or E-Mail given on their website -small print out was the only thing we got at the airport no alternative flight or anything like that. You better pray that your flight experiences no problems or you're probably as lost as I am.	0
Woke up at 4 am to a crying 21 yr old study abroad daughter who had a flight cancelled from Rome to Dublin - Aer Lingus desk information personnel did not notify my daughter that they would rebook her trip for the next day - she in turn spent an additional $1100.00 to try to get home. She is currently in a hotel (still in Rome) and was told there would be no other compensation. She'll be flying back Alitalia.	0
Flew Las Vegas to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to SFO. AirBerlin has chosen to cram as many seats as possible on the plane an Airbus A330-200 reducing the seat pitch in economy to 30 inches. To do this they removed all padding in the back of the seat and space for legs. Nearly the least comfortable seats I have ever been in and certainly the worst for an 11 hour flight. Lots of empty seats on the plane an indication of how attractive the airline is. The flight out of Las Vegas was 2 hours late in leaving; there is no online check-in for Germany-USA flights the counters do not open until 3 hours before the flight so you drag luggage around until they do open. The cabin was cold not merely cool. Otherwise the food was tolerable the drink cart did have free wine and Baileys the new - not on all flights - On-Demand entertainment system with seat back screens did have an OK selection of movies CDs TV programs; and the staff was efficient and polite. If AirBerlin in the future will get me a direct flight over a painful series of connections I would take them again - otherwise there is another German airline.	0
My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.	0
Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding. First and last time to fly AC - an airline who are really let down by the worst flight attendants I have seen.	0
"Booked to fly DCA to Quebec City via Ottawa Feb 13 leaving 7 am arriving 10.30 am. Instead after ""crew rest"" issues delayed the first flight ended up doing: DCA to Toronto where we missed our next connection due to delayed flight; and then the next flight was cancelled (no snow that day) and after much negotiation with bored reps (and a 1 hour hold with customer service) we ended up Toronto to Montreal where we were promised we could get to Quebec City but when we arrived they couldn't book us for 48 more hours to Quebec. Ended up renting a car in Montreal and driving to Quebec City where our bags were lost for another day. 3 hour process turned into 24 hours and we never arrived at our destination via Air Canada. Were promised flights that didn't exist no apologies. Never again."	0
I have been Super Elite on Air Canada for many years but this now comes to an end. The change to Rouge service for popular destinations from Vancouver is the reason. I cannot fit in the economy despite being slim and fit. My legs don't fit!. I flew the business class and it was disgusting. Terrible food and kids providing service. I have switched to Alaska and West Jet as a result. I will also note that the new business class seats on Air Canada long haul service are the worst I have ever experienced. There is no room to extend your legs and the tray is impossible to figure out.	0
"I flew from YVR-HNL on March 6th and was assigned the one lonely seat right at the back of the plane in row 51. I asked the gate agent politely if there was any chance he could move me up. He was helpful and moved me up to Row 21 where there was an empty seat. The in-flight entertainment was ok for the 6+ hours flight enough to get me there (because I can't sleep on planes.) I was also starving halfway through the flight but wasn't interested in pay $13.50 for a wrap so shelled out the $4.50 for pretzels and hummus as there was no free snack offered to go with my Diet pop. My flight from HNL-YVR was cancelled. I had checked in online already but when I got to the airport (2 hours before take off) I noticed the lines at the ticket booths were not moving at all and there was an already overall miserable feeling mulling about between the guests. I overheard someone say the flight was cancelled. I never even received a notification regarding this fact until it was close to boarding time. There were already guests checked through bags checked and they were told to come back through security to the ticket booths so they could be assigned a hotel to stay at overnight. Our aircraft never showed up due to ""mechanical problems"". It wouldn't be departing until the following day at 1.30pm. All connecting flights in Vancouver to my final destination (Winnipeg) would've already been long gone so I would've been stuck with an overnight in Vancouver the following night. I was flying alone however the rest of my family was on a WestJet flight scheduled to leave 15 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off. I asked the lady at the ticket counter what my options were and if she'd be able to help get on the WestJet flight instead. She kept blowing me off telling me there was nothing she could do nor did she seem like she was willing to help me in anyway. The lady at the Westjet counter immediately took all information and got me on the flight with no problems. Needless to say Air Canada Rouge definitely disappointed me big time. No wonder the flight was ridiculously cheap!"	0
In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.	0
LHR to YYZ on 12 Dec. The flight was 4.5 hours late food was awful and then to top it off my luggage was left behind at LHR. Return trip was just as awful with the standard cramped seats and to top it off they messed up my meal (dietary requirements) not once but twice. The meal was given to the wrong passenger and when I spoke to the flight attendant all I got was an apology that they did not have anything else to offer. Then they repeat the mistake again during snack time. If it weren't for the virtual monopoly on the LHR-YYZ I would not be travelling with AC ever again.	0
Air Canada continually disappoints. Their loyalty program is worthless unless you want to cash in your points for a flight with 3 connections and even then you still have to pay $500 in taxes and fees along with your points. Flew to Jamaica on AC Rouge as part of a vacation package. Worst plane ever nice flight attendants that had to deal with the airlines inability to properly stock food and beverage (they ran out of everything about a half way through the service so half the plane had nothing to eat). Both outgoing and return flights were an hour late in arriving. Other than some of their non Rouge planes being nice and the entertainment in those planes being pretty solid there is not much good to say about this overpriced airline and their ability to deliver flights on time and in a satisfactory manner.	0
Staff unfriendly and impolite they were eating during our conversation at the front desk. I had a flight from London Stansted to Verona they cancelled it without informing me because I booked trough Edreams. I had been waiting for 5 hours at the airport no information displayed no apology and I had to pay the transport from Stansted to Gatwick. I tried to complain with the customer service via email but no reply at all.	0
First time flying Toronto to Jamaica with Air Canada rouge and never again will I fly AC Rouge. I will be cancelling my Visa Aeroplan and start using Adventura. The seats were so uncomfortable I had to roll-up my husbands sweater and stuff it behind my lower back. Having to use tablets to view movies etc is a real pain. Trying to eat and view / hold your tablet is difficult. Plus the TV shows are old and movies are old as well. Low budget airline at no discounted cost.	0
"Quite simply the worst ""business class"" cabin I have ever had the misfortune of traveling in. ""Premium"" class seats on Air Canada Rouge are the exact same size as economy class seats. Flight was one hour late and not properly groomed in between flights. Lots of garbage left on plane. Also heard a couple of elderly people complain at the gate that no pre-boarding was being offered. Once airborne service was non-existent. No meal offered on a 5 hour international flight? Again this is supposed to be ""premium"" class. No blankets. Cabin was freezing. No seat back entertainment iPads were offered that were glitchy and the flight attendant seemed annoyed when I asked for ear buds. I could go on and on. Just a total disaster every step of the way. Air Canada is my airline of choice but avoid Rouge at all costs. I usually only give reviews to companies when it's something positive and the service was remarkable. But Rouge is just remarkably bad. One star."	0
Travelled on flight AC034 Sydney to Vancouver on October 14 the staff were not very friendly or happy. Moving around or using the bathroom was very difficult as the seat belt signs were kept on for most of the flight even when the conditions weren't turbulent. Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful.	0
London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.	0
Berlin to Cologne. We left 90 mins late so arrived 90 mins late. But what made me angry most was the missing empathy of the unfriendly crew for the passengers who had to wait 1.5 hrs in the dry-air cabin without any offers of water to drink.	0
Second time flying Rouge. Air Canada should take their name off of this disaster of a discount carrier as it will kill their overall reputation. Our first trip was with our 2 year old to Florida. Flight was delayed 7 hours with no information as to why. When we got to Orlando we had to wait an addition 3 hours for our bags. This flight is to Cancun. Was supposed to leave at 10 am finally left at 7.30pm. Again no reasons given. Flight was packed and seats were cramped. I could go on and on about all the negatives but Rouge is a disaster. I have always liked Air Canada but Rouge has killed all the goodwill Air Canada had built up with me over the years.	0
YYC to YXE. I politely asked the check in personal at Calgary a basic question about baggage fees and received a very defensive rude response. Customer service does not appear to be much of a priority. Flight attendant was not particularly friendly and had minimal interaction with passengers. I find the overall experience much more efficient on Westjet and they're fleet is newer too.	0
"We were booked home in January 2015 on an Air Canada Rouge flight and charged full points by Aeroplan as per the normal Business Class on Air Canada flights. I do not know how Air Canada can pass off this ""Business Class"" on their Rouge flight as equal to their normal Business Class accommodation which they offer. Clearly I questioned the Aeroplan representative when told we would fly home on Rouge and was told it is the same as regular Air Canada Business Class although not the pods but with adequate comfort and leg room. To say that the seating was inadequate would be an understatement. We have traveled Air Canada Business Class annually YVR to OGG and have never encountered such sub-standard cramped seating with minimal leg room. My husband and I are tall people this being one of the reasons we choose Business or Executive Class. I was barely able to walk when we finally landed in Vancouver. This type of accommodation can cause a health issue for many people. You charge for Executive Class and provide less than adequate Economy seating. Since 2004 we have travelled to Maui annually and paid the extra Aeroplan points for the comfort of the Business Class. In our estimation we got less than Economy. Most of the Canadians whom we encountered on Maui who had flown Air Canada Rouge Business Class were horrified and the reports we received were of great concern to us. Even though we had been privy to these negative comments we felt that being Air Canada it could not be that unsatisfactory. Therefore based on past experience we embarked upon this flight with open minds. We were quite incorrect it was far worse than anything we could have imagined. This is gross misrepresentation on the part of Aeroplan and Air Canada. If Rouge is the only flight Air Canada is offering between Vancouver and the Hawaiian islands then we will be seeking flights with other airlines in the future. At best it was ""Cattle Class"" accommodation. I can only imagine the cramped conditions for the people in Economy."	0
Flew from Vancouver to Phoenix - had no idea how uncomfortable the seats were when I booked the flight otherwise would have chosen a different airline. I have some hip/sciatica issues and suffered for days after. Will not fly on Rouge ever again.	0
Air Canada have either revamped or replaced their 777s and they are now 3x4x3. I was stuck with a large woman next to me a seat leg directly in front of where my feet needed to go and the leg had an entertainment control box on either side of it in effect requiring me to have no legs as there was nowhere to put my feet. If I had been a 6 foot+ man I would have been miserable. The new leather seats are harder than the old ones and are very uncomfortable. The screen can no longer be angled. The service was the one thing which has not changed it was as dreadful as it has always been. We will after 25 years of flying with AC be looking for a new carrier. The two 9 hour+ flights were pure misery.	0
Checking in on our flight from Toronto to Copenhagen our pre-booked window seats had been taken by another reservation agent. Despite written confirmation stating our seat selection my travel companion and I had to sit three rows apart in seats D and F.	0
Dusseldorf-Bangkok return. Check in at Dusseldorf airport took a long time. Staff is unfriendly and not much service or help at check in. One customer before me had a problem with small overweight handbag. Staff just shouted at him. No window seats available although later in the airplane there were empty seats occupied by staff. Food poor. On my return from Chiang Mai transit was poorly coordinated by Air Berlin. Only by help through Thai Airways was I able to find transit point and catch my flight in time. Air Berlin also forget at first to file my correct passport number - had to return at check in. Flight back horrible - no window seats just small seat in the middle. Not enough space for legs. Seat in front of me failed to work so less space. Staff seemed not to care about this problem. Flight arrived on schedule very slow unloading of the bags. For a budget airline it is pretty expensive. The attitude is arrogant.	0
Rouge does an injustice to Air Canada mainline. I am an AC frequent flyer and will look for alternate carriers if the only option is Rouge. Flight to Tampa on January 18th was a 18.50 departure and we got off the ground at 00.30 on the 19th. Trip home on the 23rd was delayed over 3 hours. Not sure what the issues were but weather was not one of them. I have no problem with one delay but two in a week makes me think that these folks have some issues. Seats also leave something to be desired and Rouge should be renamed Crampjet!	0
"AC1837 December 30 2014 Toronto to Phoenix Arizona. I normally enjoy flying Air Canada even tango is more preferred than other airlines. Air Canada Rouge is the least comfortable airline I've ever been on. I am 5'5"" and if I didn't sit up perfectly straight my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. My boyfriend who is 6""3' was quite a bit larger then the space that he was provided. The poor person in front of us had issues reclining because his knees were in her seat. Air Canada is great as long as there is no rouge tacked on at the end."	0
Have travelled several times between Toronto to Phoenix - always a good service. Went on Rouge the worst flight ever. Did not tell us we had to download an app to get inflight entertainment until 15 mins in the air so nothing to watch on the 5 hr flight. Packed in like cattle no leg room.	0
"Brutal seats. I am 6'4"" and could barely get into the seat. The passenger in front of me insisted on reclining his seat back. The AC Rouge website states that the slimline seats provide more room and more comfort. My legs are still swollen from the flight. The only good thing about flight 1892 YYZ to Tampa on January 16 was the inflight cabin attendants. I will never fly Rouge again."	0
For a business class ticket price this was a waste of an upgraded price. The seats do not recline far enough to rest comfortable the inflight iPad usage is really not conducive to eating in flight and your posture is compromised while viewing a the iPad needs to sit on your tray table thus causing your neck to bend downwards. I watched as passengers tried to eat while positioning their iPad here or there. It was really bothersome. It was not a comfortable flight. We fly to Maui several times a year and this is not my preferred airline for sure - Air Canada Rouge is not what I would choose to fly. I was very disappointed overall.	0
LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.	0
No entertainment from Toronto to Lisbon simply lights out. While I had entertainment from LA to Toronto my daughter had none for both legs of the trip. I can not imagine in this day and age that an airline offers no entertainment. Food was okay but you must pay for wine on international leg of trip. I think it's either BA or AF from now on.	0
YYC-LAS LAS-YYC. This itinerary was made tolerable by the fact I was able to upgrade both flights using aeroplan e credits. Very uncomfortable seats on the 319 to LAS and the so called Premium Rouge reminds me of Canadian early 90s on their 737 with the seat next to you not sold. Food was OK both flights but obviously cut rate from mainline J eg less linen. The 767 flight to YYZ was akin to narrow body J mainline in terms of seating. I am not sure what Air Canada was thinking with the IFE what are you supposed to do with that iPod while eating? And they were handed out far too late on the first flight. I did not get through the movie I was watching. If I had to wear a uniform like that to work I would not be doing so proudly! I will avoid Rouge if at all possible in the future.	0
"I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time the beginning of January. They should rename it Air Canada Sardine Can. I am only 5 foot 3 inches and my knees were hitting the seat in front of me. I dropped my glasses on the floor and there was no way I could get them and was told by the steward on the plane that there is nothing he could do that I would have to wait until the plane was empty and then I could try to reach and get them and then he said nothing else can be done and my reply was ""fly another airline"". Going into Cuba I had 3 forms to fill out and they gave them to us as we were starting to land and then told to put our trays up and we could not use the trays to fill out the forms. Very poor service and you are crammed in as I said like sardines."	0
26th September 1.5 hours late leaving London Heathrow for Montreal. Knew I would miss my connecting flight to Toronto City where I had family waiting for me. Was assured from the aircrew that Air Canada ground crew were aware of the delay and arrangements had been made to fly Toronto passengers out on two flights. All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet. After lots of chasing around from one departure gate to another I was eventually put on a flight to Toronto Pearson which resulted in my sister having to dash across Toronto at the last minute. Furthermore it seems my luggage arrived on an earlier flight isn't that a security breach? All in all a very poor service from Air Canada which has resulted in me vowing never to fly with them again going back to Air Transat.	0
VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.	1
I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are. The airplanes could be cleaned better and I do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff.	1
I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration	1
We flew on flights 4441 and 4440 on 22nd June and 29th June. Both flights were excellent, smooth, cabin staff immaculately dressed and professional. I would use this airline again. Perhaps a free snack like a sandwich or crackers and cheese would enhance the experience.	1
I am always impressed with the pleasant attitude, responsive service and  warmth of cabin crew. The ground service is good, and the food is on the good side. On the other hand, most of their planes are starting to show their age and sometimes the seats are really worn out.	1
Multiple trip with AE between SKG-FRA and MUC. Aircraft's were always clean service was fine food above average and quite good compared to other regular European airlines and the staff was always courteous and friendly. There were only couple times out of the last maybe 30 round trips the flight was delayed and that happened summertime when the European skies are congested. I have great respect for this airline and how nicely developed to become one of the best regional airlines of Europe.	1
Flew from Athens to Brussels. Aircraft was very clean and well maintained. Cabin crew were immaculately smartly turned out and friendly. In flight food was good quality. Pretty comfortable seats. No inflight entertainment though.	1
I had a very pleasant experience flying with Aer Lingus. Although the business class is not up to par with most other airlines, it is far from bad and the service was great - Irish hospitality at its best!	1
FCO-ATH-LCA-ATH all in business as using points. Easy check-in. Quality of meals and wine excellent for short . flights. Attentive staff -although as first two flights only 3 of us out of possible 8 to be expected. Really did run a separate bus on arrival for just 3 business class passengers at ATH and LCA.	1
Excellent friendly service. Able to fly in and out of Cardiff when other flights were cancelled due to fog. Maybe more expensive than alternatives, but reliable. Preferred airline on the Cardiff-Dublin route.	1
10/5 Sunday flight Dublin to LHR. Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.	1
Traveled on Aegean twice this week ATH-HER RT and ATH-MAD. All flights on time crews were polite and professional. I fly economy everywhere and expect uncomfortable seats (they were) but while I don't like it realize that's the way economy is so if flights are on time I'm satisfied. Aegean even supplied a meal in coach for the ATH-MAD flight which no USA airline does. I would fly again with Aegean and recommend.	1
You go up. You go down. Flight is over. This 20 min flight from Athens to Mykonos on an A320 does what it needs to do get you to your destination.	1
I fly LGW-DUB-LGW every fortnight. The crew are always extremely friendly considering it is 06.50am and 20.50 on the return. The service is great and they always smile  welcome everyone on board unlike the other Irish airline. However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.	1
Munich-Athens-Munich. Both flights on time very clean and comfortable Airbus A320/321 planes. Beautiful well- groomed and very nice young cabin crew only hot meals served on both flights full bar service incl very nice Greek wines. Bags delivered within 20 mins. Highly recommended.	1
LHR-ATH leg on Aegean Airlines Flight A3601 Economy. Check in with Aegean was a breeze professional and quick. Boarding was efficient and welcomed on board by polite and attentive crew with genuine smiles. Nice to see New Airbus A321 clean outside and spotless interior. Lunch consisted of tasty Greek meatballs with potatoes which was delicious. Greek salad as starter and a nice dessert. Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service. Return leg ATH-LHR was just as pleasant. Found the whole Aegean experience to be very comfortable with polite attentive crew and good service throughout. Would have no hesitation in using them again.	1
"JFK-DUB - First time flying Aer Lingus transatlantic and being Irish was looking forward to the service having previously flown Delta BA and Air France. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options. Management really need to look at what the competition are offering charging for things and being scabby on long flights is not really on in this day and age."	1
The service was great. There was enough food and it was tasty (2 full meals and snacks and drinks whenever you want). Takeoff and landing were great. Cabin crew was pleasant in general. There were some bad aspects of the flight, such as very slow entertainment system, big delay for more than 3 hours. In general the flight was good except the delay in Vladivostok airport.	1
Our nonstop flight from LED to SXF was cancelled some weeks before travel and we were re-booked on a flight via SVO which meant approximately twice the original flight time, but we had no problem getting to know a new airport. The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame. We were quite impressed by SU and would not hesitate to use them again, especially when they offer a decent rate to Asia in their new Premium Economy.	1
3/10/14 London Heathrow to Dublin Flight EI155. I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.	1
Athens-Dusseldorf. Pleasant flight catering could be better. The negative part was the ground staff (at the gate): they changed without asking us the flight by transferring us to the next flight.	1
Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.	1
SVO-PEK and back. I have travelled with Aeroflot several times within the past year I have to say that the level of service you get with this airline is inconsistent. Compared to my last trip with them (STR-SVO-LED and back) which was extremely satisfying this time the service is only so-so. For SVO-PEK the cabin crew seemed inexperienced. The crew disappeared immediately after dinner service. The food from SVO is very average and the cleanliness of the toilet was not maintained well during the flight. For the return trip the crew members seemed much more experienced and they delivered a fairly high level of service. The food was also significantly better. Overall I think Aeroflot is improving. However they still have a long way to go. As a passenger your experience with them can vary greatly depending on the crew or the route. But considering the price which was very competitive I must say that what I got for this trip was fair.	1
Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.	1
Flew with Aeroflot CPH-SVO-NRT. Excellent service. I am a tall guy and Economy Class is usually a nightmare especially on long-haul flights. On my trip to Tokyo the flight attendants noticed that I was struggling to get room for my knees and offered me one of their personal seats which had more legroom and since these seats did not have any entertainment system the crew made sure I was comfortable for giving me extra drinks. (I got a full bottle of wine for free!!) Aeroflot has become an excellent airline and I will be happy to travel with them again.	1
Flew CPH-SVO-BKK and back in economy class in brand new Boeing 777-300er. Seating a bit cramped due to the 3-4-3 configuration. I guess the only complaint is the food which was horrible. Cabin crew helpful and efficient. No alcohol policy on airline due to incidents with drunk passengers. But overall Aeroflot did a good job getting us from a to b via SVO. We would book again with Aeroflot. But a food upgrade would be nice.	1
I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737-800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight! We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.	1
MUC-SKG-ATH-HER-MUC: All flights on time with smiles clean aircraft and decent catering. Overall impeccable and a pleasure to fly!	1
I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.	1
Rio to Buenos Aires AEP on 737. Departure delayed by 30min and arrival to AEP slightly behind schedule. Plane in good condition (must say that the new livery looks better than the old one). Sandwich and drink offered during flight. Crew fine. AEP is easy to navigate. Luggage (priority tagged as FB Elite) arrived fairly quickly and first on band. Was dreading flying AR but flight was overall fine. Planning to fly them long haul in C class from Spain in May.	1
NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!	1
I traveled with my two daughters 18 and 13 years old respectively from Dulles International Airport to Moscow with Athens as our final destination. Getting there was a bit stressful because the flight connection was too close for comfort and we had to run to make the Athens flight. The crew was rather parochial. They did not speak much English and their manners were not the best. Food was poor but not horrible. Movie choices pretty decent and the actual flights were very smooth. The pilots were quite good judging by the take offs and landings. The price was unbeatable and though this was not stellar service I would choose again if their prices remained low.	1
I traveled from Tel Aviv to Toronto via Moscow. It was a last minute booking the price superb and the service excellent - especially for economy class. The food was on par for international flights but I really appreciated the courtesy of the staff. I would not hesitate to fly Aeroflot again.	1
St Petersburg - Moscow. Ticket purchased at last minute and check in a bit confusing directed to about three different counters but each without a large queue. Flight was comfortable and only a few minutes late arriving in Moscow. No IFE but it was only a little more than a hour long flight. Cabin crew were friendly and responsive and spoke reasonable English. It was like a shuttle flight and perfectly adequate. Leg room was adequate.	1
Larnaca - Rhodes return. Both flights on time comfy seats and friendly cabin crew. No inflight entertainment probably because it was a short flight but a good experience to fly with Aegean.	1
Flew LAX-SVO-Yervan and back I was concerned having heard mixed reviews but was pleasantly surprised! Flights were on time baggage arrived perfectly the colors and atmosphere on the plane was bright and cheery. I flew economy so like any other airlines you get what you pay for as far as cabin space however in all other respects Aeroflot was superior. Cabin crew were professional and polite food was quite good. Entertainment was superb with 100's of great movies and shows to choose from as well as games wifi charging stations and all the works! I travelled with my children 4 and 7 and had no trouble keeping them busy for 12 hours. Children's meals can be pre-ordered and were well thought out although my picky ones didn't eat them. Kids got tons of goodies from the staff. The value was great and I will fly with them again in the future. My only complaint were the tiny and rather dirty bathrooms. Otherwise excellent airline!	1
Flew Istanbul-Athens. Plane was new and clean staff warm and friendly and they served drinks and a sandwich on this 1-hour flight. This airline deserves more than a 3-star ranking in my opinion.	1
STR-SKG-ATH-TLV. Slightly delayed departure in STR but arrival on time in ATH after short stop in SKG. Great food and good selection of beverages. Departure from ATH was several hours delayed due to striking ground staff. Received vouchers for snacks. Definitively recommended.	1
Shanghai to Tehran return July 2012. Direct flight to Tehran. Economy class. Aircraft A310. Fare was quite good. Check-in fast. Cabin crew showed Iranian hospitality. No individual inflight entertainment but fairly speaking since the flight was at night. One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai. Considering all the above I will certainly choose this airline next time for my trip to Tehran.	1
LGW-BHD EI021 31 July 14. Excellent customer service and particularly impressed with clear communication and politeness of cabin manager on this flight. A320 seats much more comfortable than the A319s that EI also operate on this route.	1
Dublin to SFO - good seat space good inflight entertainment pleasant crew flight on time dinner and snack tasted good. From SFO to Dublin - all was good as above except for the meals these were tasteless.	1
LED-SVO-STR. Very good experience overall. Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent. I think it is really time to change the stereotype that many of us had for the Russian national carrier for many years!	1
Aegean started regular non-stop flights between IEV and ATH in Spring 2013. The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage. Overall experience is good would definitely fly again for a reasonable price.	1
Excellent service and courteous employees. I flew from Puerto Vallarta and had to change planes in Mexico City for flight to Los Angeles. One glitch - my bag was put on a later flight ( about 30 to 40 minutes) along with 20 to 30 other travelers. It was frustrating standing around and wondering until an announcement was finally made.	1
FRA-ATH. May 25. A321. Boarding totally messy. Excellent food and drinks. Extremely pleasant staff. Luggage arrived very quickly.	1
We recently traveled on 3 domestic flights within Argentina - Buenos Aires - Iguazu - Salta - Buenos Aires. We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.	1
My wife and I flew from PEK-LHR with a tight 50 minute connection at SVO. Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors. And price wise they are way ahead of the game. It's a shame they use SVO as their hub however.	1
SKG-ATH-FCO return. A320 and A321. All flights about 70% full. Clean cabin friendly and nice crew comfortable seats. Food ok just a sandwich and free drinks. Smooth flights and arrivals ahead of schedule.	1
Flew with Aer Lingus to Boston on flight EI 139. Economy. Flew on the A330 to and from. Excellent plane. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the €17.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this. Unfortunately I couldn't get this meal on the way back sold out. However the meal we got was still lovely. Overall would like to fly with Aer Lingus in the future again. Would recommend them.	1
AM633 on 21 August SAT-MEX and AM632 on August 25 MEX-SAT. Short trip from SAT to MEX and return on Embraer jet. First time on AM and it was a terrific experience crew were efficient aircraft clean and very well maintained. Snack service was tasty with fresh choices and excellent bar service. I will gladly take AM again as my travel plans permit.	1
We fly Aeromexico JFK to Cancun. We use them whenever we can. The reasons are many but here are some. The crew are very accommodating and always courteous. We enjoy having food to eat. If there is an empty seat after takeoff we were allowed to move. The plane was new.	1
Flew from Bristol to Dublin for the Giro D'Italia using Aer Lingus Regional (Aer Arran). Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.	1
Flew JFK-SVO-BEY-SVO-JFK. The price of ticket was 200$-300$ cheaper than the price of a ticket with other airlines. All flights were ok. If not on time either late by a couple of minutes or early by a couple of minutes. IFE great. Staff OK. One of the things I didn't like is the food. It is edible but it is always beef or chicken with a salad or cheese with ham (on all flights) the meals are not diversified. I didn't like the seats. I'm 190cm so it was really uncomfortable for me to sit in this seat for a flight of 9-10hrs but it shouldn't be the same problem for someone shorter. Airport is good. Staff is friendly. Terminal D and E are new and spacious but terminal F is over crowded and there is a lot of stores and not a lot of places to sit. Overall the experience was good. Will take them again and recommend them to someone if price is good.	1
Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!	1
Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.	1
JFK-MEX-ZIH and return. JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.	1
Paris-Athens-Mytilini. Compared to the competition this is the only option for Greece. Friendly service good hot food at lunch and evening flight with wine seat comfortable aircraft modern clean and on time. Overall very good.	1
ATH-FRA. Another great experience with Aegean on a clean and relatively new aircraft with a meal served by polite and caring crew. Although a moving map was displayed throughout the cabin a movie or some other form of entertainment would have been appreciated for this 3-hour flight (I flew Aegean to London before and a movie was shown). Regardless this airline is a pleasure to fly.	1
Flew YYZ-MOW-YYZ. Both flights were excellent. Sheremetyevo airport very modern comfortable there was barely any line-up for customs and security screenings. Security was painless compared to the US and Canadian ones. Food was great I asked for an extra meal on both flights and they gave it to me. The offered wine for free in economy class. FA also friendly. The only concern is the delays. When I flew there the delay was 40 min on the way back the washroom broke down in the aircraft so the delay was 4 hours. They gave us meal vouchers so we got free food at SVO.	1
Moscow-Tenerife on A330-300 long haul. The service was incredible (actually as usual on Aeroflot long haul flights in business class compared to short haul it is better). Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good. Entertainment system has a big variety of films and all films can be watched in either Russian or English. In my opinion Aeroflot on long hauls is much better than the majority of other European airlines.	1
Charter service from Tel Aviv to Heraklion. A320 new and clean all leather seats. Only drinks served. All female crew seemed completely disinterested. Airshow available however no position of the aircraft available only the map of the area. Heard good things about A3 service however that was not the experience we had.	1
LYS-ORN. Clean and new aircraft FA's could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.	1
I have flown a number of long distance and internal flights and am pleased with the airline. The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom. The website is great and service when things go wrong is also friendly and good.	1
Flight SU23/SU2618 LED-SVO / SVO-BRU 23/06/2013. Check in at Poltava was OK. It was possible to check in for the connecting flight to Brussels. Flight LED-SVO got a delay of almost 25 minutes. Probably the delay was caused by the used plane (Airbus A330 i.o. A320). It takes more time to board 320 people instead of 120. Plane was clean service on board was OK. Staff very friendly. Due to the delay our transit time was extremely short. We had to run to catch the connecting flight. Connecting flight was on schedule. Plane (Airbus 319) was clean service on board was great. We arrived on time in Brussels and unbelievably our luggage was on board and arrived as well!	1
Madrid - Dublin EI 595 22/12/13. Check/baggage drop in Madrid (sub contractor) slow inefficient. Aircraft clean comfortable. Punctuality slight delay on departure arrival on time. Flight attendants efficient friendly and very professional. Greatly improved offerings of food on board at reasonable prices. Baggage delivered speedily on arrival in Dublin. Altogether excellent flight and service. They do however need to watch that they are not let down by ground handling agents.	1
Flew Aerolineas/Austral on a domestic flight AEP-IGR and I have nothing to complain about. Check-in was good. Fairly new planes (E190) with IFE even for this short flight of slightly less than 2 hours. Was served a sandwich and something to drink.	1
"11/11/2013 my companion and I flew from San Antonio to Chicago and there caught Aer Lingus Flight EI124. The Aircraft was an Airbus 330. The Senior Crew Flight attendant was a very compassionate woman who attended to us and all of those around us with interest and tenacity. The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44"" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well. We had the same seats on the opposite side of the cabin. The amenities of even economy class on this Airline are excellent and a great value. The equipment is first class and the crew made me proud to be Irish American."	1
Hamburg-Moscow-Shanghai. HAM-SVO on A320 smooth check-In with 2 boarding passes (HAM-SVO and SVO- PVG). C-lounge with basic refreshment. HAM-SVO C class cabin seat and service were excellent. Arrival at SVO new Terminal D quick and easy transit at both passport/security. SVO-PVG departed from Terminal F very long walkway from D to F. Terminal F awful old/dark/busy. Lounge at Terminal F was difficult to find. I was refused entry because I did not have the invitation card. Had to go to transit desk. After entering I noted the lounge was full no seat available. Flight to Shanghai on time with new and clean A330. Seats 2-2-2 not full flat but comfortable to sleep. Good onboard service greeting by purser/crews with good English skill. Foods (3 choices) very tasty. AVOD with 500 programs. Return: quick check-in with 2 boarding passes good spacious lounge. Flight PVG-SVO at 1.30 am. Old/tired B767 seat 2-2-2 narrow and less comfortable than A330 portable IFE with DVD-player same good onboard service. Landed at Terminal F and lesson learned went to transit desk asking for C-Lounge Access card. SVO-HAM A320 left Terminal D on time with best European C Class cabin I have flown. Good products with following minus points: No priority boarding on all legs no priority handling of baggage chaotic handling at SVO Airport.	1
CMN-BRU. For a LCC Air Arabia has been a welcome surprise. They offer you 20 kg baggage allowance new airplanes decent seats and a fresh crew. For a price/quality comparison they are better than Air Maroc. But their website is often malfunctioning certain routes are deleted without notice time tables suddenly change and they often leave at ungodly hours. I'm satisfied with this airline and will keep flying them if they keep their standards to the current level.	1
AEP-FTE in Club Economy. Check-in at AEP was confusing proceeded to departure lounge upstairs. There is no VIP saloon at this airport for Club Economy passengers. Equipment was an old MD88 that was worn. No IFE. Seat pitch was around 35” or so. A lunch box was distributed shortly after take off - a stale sandwich a packaged cake and a pack of nuts. Drink service followed and FA's disappeared. No second round of drinks. Toilet was dirty. For a 3 hour flight I would expect a more substantive meal in the “premium” cabin. My bags were amongst the last to come out despite marked “priority” on the tag.	1
Delay of more than 12 hours. Rude and unhelpful staff in Moscow lack of any kind of information post service inexistent. On the way back from MAD to BKK first flight got delayed 2.5 hours so when we arrive in SVO connection to BKK had already departed. Instead of giving us a hotel they gave us a boarding pass to Seoul! We arrived to Seoul without any idea of what to do next nobody say anything to us no information. There they gave us a boarding pass to BKK with Korean airlines for 6 hours later. Arrive into Bangkok with more than 12 hours delay they inform us that our bags were still in Moscow. The worst customer service.	1
ATH-LHR A320. Flight arrived in London early but luggage delivery so slow in T1 it didn't make any difference. Decent service food horrible as always. New and clean plane. Decent movie onboard.	1
Feb 8 2013 flight AM192 MEX-PVR Embraer 170. My first time on this type of aircraft. I liked the large windows and larger seats. One thing though leather seats tend to have you slide down and slouch. Flight was on time staff friendly bags delivered by the time I had deplaned.	1
Astana-Istanbul-Astana on March 16-18 2015. It was one of my best flight experiences starting from check-in inflight meal offering and friendly approach of flight attendants. It was worth every cent I paid.	1
Staff excellent customer service oriented meals are good and the planes are new. The seats are comfortable and lounge in Athens has a smoking area that is not packed.	1
12/2/15 KS942/952 London - Almaty. 21/2/15 KS601/941 Almaty - London. You really get the feeling with Air Astana that the company is genuinely striving for improvement all the time. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful planes are really clean flights generally arrive on time. The new economy sleeper is a winning option for people who dread the loss of a nights sleep but cannot bring themselves to fork out the full business class fare. I travelled with my four children and we all thought economy sleeper was brilliant. At least a chance of sleep much more space quieter cabin and better food that in economy.	1
I have often flown Aegean and I always look forward to. Nice service only bad thing - occasionally you book with Aegean and end up having a return flight or a second leg with an inferior company. Make sure you check what connections and return flights are involved.	1
Flight KC930 24 February. Return trip from Hong Kong in mid February. Plane was very delayed but informed. Could in my view been done earlier but was nice to be told a couple of hours in advance. Trip itself was pleasant. Good inflight entertainment and again the inflight crew did an excellent job and were responsive to needs. Food could be improved as compared to other airlines traveled but do note it is economy class.	1
ALA-TSE. B757-200 not new AC but fully refurbished to perfection. Clean and inviting. Crew very well groomed wonderful IFE tasty hot snack on this 80 min flight. Temp however was very high in the cabin and my req to lower it a bit were not fulfilled. I started to feel ill and asked for ice to cool my head crew showed no empathy or care. I was glad it was a short flight.	1
GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.	1
LHR-ATH-JMK. Bags were transferred seamlessly at Athens which was my main concern. LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.	1
HAM-SVO-HAM first time with AFL-Business class. Check In at Hamburg very quick. Shared Lounge with acceptable refreshments. Boarding well organized. The big surprise was the C Class cabin. It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D. SVO- HAM also at Terminal D - quick Check-In / AFL own lounge without window but offers better quality and quantity of refreshments than Hamburg lounge. Return flight with same great experience. AFL offers an excellence Business class product much better than those established European Airlines.	1
LAX-MEX-GRU in Business. Very fast check-in at LAX however the lounge wasn't open which was awkward. Flight to MEX was comfortable however the flight attendant couldn't be bothered to do anything with the meal and the omelette was served cold. Club Premier lounge in DF was great with food wine and showers. Flight to Sao Paulo was average food was great however I didn't think the seat was as comfortable as LAN. All in all decent - much better than an American airline to S America.	1
Excellent fast and efficient. Flew JFK-MEX on their red-eye flight. Did Web check-in and made a quick baggage drop. Movie and two TV episodes as inflight entertainment. A nice sandwich for midnight snack/dinner. Early Departure and early arrival to MEX. Bags were already waiting in carrousel after arrival.	1
Athens - Heathrow route. Arrived at terminal 1 30mins late due to air traffic. Had another 2.5 hrs to collect baggage and check in at terminal 5 for a domestic flight on BA. A fast walk to the baggage claim took about 20mins and thereafter waited another 30mins for the baggage to arrive. By the time someone accepted us at one of the many empty counters it was already too late. We missed our connection I strongly recommend allowing at least 4 hrs to connect from terminal 1 to 5. The airline itself is very good. Clean and new A321 friendly flight crew and free drinks onboard meal was average.	1
Having flown several times with Aer Lingus decided to upgrade to their Business Class cabin from Manchester to Chicago via Dublin. Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch. Overall great experience and have already booked Business Class for my next trip to Boston in October.	1
Mixed business and economy between Manchester and Boston. Staff provided warm professional service - first rate. Experience from check-in to baggage claim was hassle free. Business class food was great - much better than expected. Seat was very comfortable. Really good value for money - certainly will fly with them again.	1
AMS-KJA-AMS. Boarding in Amsterdam was the horror - more than half an hour at the business class check in and total mess in the departure area. AMS-SVO was okay. Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.	1
SYD-RUN-SEZ. Very attentive crew . Good and adequate food crew offering water . Leather seats comfortable and clean 777-300. More IFE options of movies and other programmes would make it better.	1
Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.	1
Salta-Puerto Iguazu domestic flight operated by Austral. Flight a Embraer 190 with personal entertainment with TV series and documentaries and some CD's. The entertainment system failed twice but the crew reactivated it quick. Did not expected entertainment on a domestic flight. The crew offered a sandwich with a drink. Good legroom at emergency exit but the normal seats also offered good legroom for this short flight of 1.5 hrs. Departed 2O mins early and landed 40 mins early in Iguazu.	1
CDG-RUN-ZSE. Outstanding service for the economy class good food very nice ground staff and crew. Fleet is modern with B777 with high quality entertainment system. Seat pitch tight and slightly cramped. RUN airport is small and allows very short connecting time if need to continue journey to east or Saint Pierre airport.	1
Recently flew throughout Myanmar on the following routes: Yangon-Mandalay-Heho-Mandalay-Nyaung U (Bagan)-Heho-Thandwe-Yangon on their Fokker 100 and ATR72 aircraft. Check-in interesting as there are no computers and everything is weighed manually. Ground crew cordial but not overly friendly. Flight crews were friendly and always helpful. Catering is good for the short flights with croissants and drinks being offered on even the shortest of flights (unthinkable in Europe). Aircraft's were always spotless and comfortable.	1
MIA-MEX on Boeing 737 and MEX-DGO on Embraer 190. Clean modern aircraft. Served breakfast and drinks by friendly flight crew. Flights on time and terminal 2 in Mexico city airport out is amazing.	1
Have travelled with Aegean a number of times already and service is impeccable. Ground crew eager to help and facilitate flights on time comfortable journeys with nice meals on board.	1
Flight KC912 April 2nd from Istanbul to Almaty. It was a fantastic flight crew helpful and smiling. All announcements very clear understandable and most important things for me multi-language Turkish English Russian and Kazakh. The way aircraft was new.	1
IAH-MEX-IAH economy. First leg on B738 and E190 on the way back. Comfortable flights given that I had cheapest economy ticket and got seated in premium seat in the front of the aircraft on an outbound flight. Some breakfast items on quite a short flights were a nice touch and crew were friendly. Good value for money.	1
I flew May 3rd NYC-MOSCOW connection MOSCOW-KIEV $1500 2 adult tickets. The flight was great! On time and arrived early in Moscow on a nice Airbus A330. The plane was fairly new. The seats bathrooms and interior of the plane was excellent. The food on the transatlantic flight there and back were both great. Chicken or fish with veggies bread and chocolate. The only complaint I would make is they serve the drinks and wait too long to serve the food. They served the drinks 15 mins before the food was served so by the time I got my food I had no drink. The service was 7 of 10. The flight from Moscow to Kiev was excellent as well. 1hr and 15mins on time. Overall Aeroflot is a good airline I would fly with them again!	1
Have made several flights with Aegean Airlines in the past year. It was very good value for money. Flights mostly on time inflight service exceptional and friendly FA's. Helpful ground staff. Overall this will be my preferred carrier to Greece.	1
Mexico City - Cancun return. Clean modern 737 aircraft that departed on time professional bi-lingual flight attendants. Inflight service consisted of just a drink service (with free booze) and a pack of peanuts. Their terminal 2 at Mexico City is a beautiful modern facility. Its just a shame they don't offer online check in or self service check in.	1
LAX-Acapulco via MEX. We booked via Delta so expected to pay for baggage and have no meals. But Aeromexico baggage still free and nice meals on long leg of trip both ways. Drink and snack on 35 minute Acapulco-MEX leg. Staff were charming and helpful. We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous. The headrest appears to have been designed for crash test dummies. We had been much more comfortable in our coach seats.	1
Dublin - Santiago return. Both flights on time. Excellent service from Irish cabin crew. Food for purchase but reasonably priced and tasty. Only complaint was lack of staff at passport control in Dublin so long queues. Cant understand. Felt sorry for All non EU passport holders. Not Aer Lingus fault but only glitch in otherwise faultless travel experience.	1
PEK-ALA-TSE-SVO. Red-eye flight from Beijing to Almaty on B757-200. The aircraft is old but well-attended. Seats are ok. Cabin crew speak good English. Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us. They were very helpful and the ground crew were efficient because our baggage arrived safely at SVO. I would recommend Air Astana if the prices are adequate.	1
MAD-EZE return. On the upper deck on the way to Argentina: service was good food as well - seat worked and slept nearly the whole flight. On the way back on the much smaller lower deck flight attendant was somewhat short-sighted and set everyone in wrong seats - we had our laughs. Seat was a bit broken but found some sleep. Food wasn't so good on the flight back to Europe.	1
MEX-LIM. Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).	1
MUC-ATH. The seating was standard European Business with the middle seat blocked. The highlight of the flight was the meal which was a pasta dish with shrimp calamari and tomato sauce - simply excellent. Friendly crew and good service as well as the meal.	1
LHR-ATH-LHR. Booked at the last minute because of the BA strike. BMI lounge excellent at T1 Swissport lounge at Athens almost as good. Modern clean A321-200 seats 2A/C outbound  1D/F inbound. FAs excellent. Food service rather rushed outbound with no pre-lunch drinks and no offer of champagne pre take-off. Food average quality but good to have the Greek accent. Food service and quality similar inbound and still no sign of champagne. IFE unusually provided on a 4 hr flight but consisted of just a single film on overhead drop-down LCD screens. Priority baggage return worked remarkably well both outbound and inbound and the general efficiency of the new Athens airport was a delight. Overall a good product.	1
I have travelled many times with Aegean Airlines from Berlin to Athens Athens to Larnaca but also in domestic flights in Greece. In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.	1
EDITORIAL MESSAGE Due to concerns about authenticity of the review submitted and/or the user's name being that of the airline customer as stated on their submit form this comment has been deleted.	1
BOG to EZE on a relatively new 737. Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.	1
I flew from JFK to Dublin in June. Everything went extremely smoothly from luggage check in to luggage pick up. The personnel on the ground and on board was extremely friendly and efficient. The only drawback of the airline is the food selection and quality.	1
Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.	1
Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR. All in all it was a great flight no delays staff were extremely friendly as always check-in was simple and they also offered to check in my carry on luggage free of charge. If Aer Lingus flew from Stansted I'd fly with them anytime I was going home.	1
SVO-MUC. I didn't expect too much and therefore I was really surprised by the airline and the new terminal at Sheremetyevo airport. The crew members were friendly and could speak good English. Very good hot meal and comfortable seats. I was very satisfied.	1
Dublin - JFK on Dec 17 2012. The cabin crew were warm and helpful. I hadn't requested a vegetarian meal but the stewardess was nice enough to bring me extra salads and rolls. They came by often with drink service and to collect trash. The movies and shows available were great. I'm a very nervous flyer and as we were preparing to land a stewardess talked me through it and was very comforting.	1
ZRH-DUS-MIA and return in business class. Short flights okay (only coach class but they kept the seat next to me free). Business class seats fully flat really great if you sleep on the side (otherwise might be a bit short) staff extremely friendly meals rather uninspired (I had a pre-ordered vegetarian meal). Entertainment has a nice selection however I slept most of the time. Would fly with Air Berlin in business class.	1
PEK-ALA-SVO. Both flights arrived on time. Good food and excellent alcohol selection. Service friendly and efficient. PEK-ALA on 767 and ALA-SVO on 321 old but well maintained. Generous legroom. No individual entertainment. Overall very good value for money.	1
SEN-DUB-SEN: First time travelling with this airline and have to say very impressed. Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.	1
"HKG-SVO. Overall good flight but service could have been better for business class. Old looking cabin on A300. FA's older and quite reserved. No repeat servings and one had to ask for a drink refill. Catering good from HKG and meal very tasty. Seat comfort is ok but not designed for taller person. Priority luggage tags mean nothing with Aeroflot almost for sure your ""priority"" tagged luggage will show up last! Result was 55 mins wait at the luggage belt for delivery. SVO airport F terminal chaos at customs as usual."	1
NYC-SVO-KBP on A330-300 and A321. Prior to the flight newspapers were distributed. We were then stuck in a jam while taxiing prior to take-off. Service onboard was plain and overall very correct. I have low interest in IFE though the little I tried seemed quite correct. We were served dinner and breakfast the former with wine. We arrived on time. The transfer went smoothly and the second leg was as pleasant as the other. The fare was 30-40% cheaper than on other airlines doing the route. Great value for money and solid level of quality.	1
BUD-SVO-DEL with quite new A330-300. All flights were on time. Onboard service was great. Comfortable seats and great entertainment lot of movies music and games. Meals were lovely on BUD-SVO flight - cold meal with two drinks juice and coffee/tea. On SVO-DEL flight warm meal was served - they gave us menu before dinner so we could choose. Lot of drinks served. Cabin staff can be more polite.	1
Glasgow to Orlando via Dublin. Excellent service for the second time this year. The short flight Glasgow to Dublin is on a prop plane but is perfectly adequate for the short distance. Dublin-Orlando includes good entertainment food and most courteous cabin crew. A330 was very clean.	1
LHR-SVO-PVG returning PEK-SVO-LHR. Nice A321 to Moscow with good meal. Sheveremeteyvo Airport Terminals DE and F now interlinked though website states still bus link. B767's are old and on boarding it was noticeable that the interior had not been refurbished. Once airborne the service and food excellent. The seats were comfortable and the overhead TV had some good films. Return flight from Beijing on new Airbus A330-300 very pleasant and comfortable. Good personal seatback entertainment system with very wide screens for economy class. Lots of choice though some movies not up to date. Food good again. A321 to LHR only half full cabin crew pleasant and attentive food fine and only problem was that cabin lights not dimmed for night flight.	1
ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc). If possible please consider other supplier of noise-reducing earplugs those available in the passenger's pouch now don't reduce the noise and pressure discomfort in the cabin.	1
Alicante to Dublin on 27/10/2012. Although the flight was a little late leaving Alicante due to slow loading of passengers and hand luggage the actual journey was a pleasant experience. I thought all the staff were friendly and courteous. Arriving into Dublin well after midnight all the staff were still smiling and pleasant as passengers disembarked. I will travel again with EI as long as staff continue to smile and look like they care about passengers.	1
Dublin - Boston Return. Both flights on time. Great to clear USA immigration in Dublin. Inflight service outbound efficient but staff not as friendly as normal. Inbound staff excellent nothing too much trouble. Inflight entertainment good but on return had to ask for it to be turned on for the whole aircraft. Staff forgot. Then it had to be rebooted. All told took an hour before the IFE was up and running. All flights on time. Seats standard economy seats but comfortable enough. Great to be domestic flight into the USA. Took 15 mins from getting off the aircraft to kerbside.	1
BRU-SVO-LED PEK-SVO-BRU. Short haul flights with A320. Lots of legroom new planes. Long haul flight with new A330-300 legroom ok but bad seats who got pretty painful after a while good IFE with pretty good selection of movies. General comments : staff is good but not too enthusiastic. Food average. You have to pay for alcoholic drinks on long haul flights (alcohol banned on some flights).	1
We flew ORD to TXL on July 31 and TXL to ORD on Aug. 18. After years and years of flying with UA and having to transfer in Europe it was a relief to fly non-stop to Berlin. The cabin was clean the staff was very helpful and the food was quite acceptable. The seats were comfortable. We had requested wheelchair assistance at both ends and it was ready and waiting.	1
We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket with two little ones. Flight was a bit shaky due to monsoon season nothing that captain could do about it the aircraft was new clean food was fine crew very attentive especially the young male attendant on the way back who was superb. The seats were fine too but when the person in front reclined his seat there was unfortunately not much space to move especially with the little one on your laps. Overall it was very pleasant experience and we will fly with Air Berlin again.	1
Atyrau to Almaty - friendly service with right amount of attention 3 meal choices excellent legroom great selection of music. Most comfortable.	1
Travelled with Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Aer Arann) return from Birmingham to Shannon. Flights early in both directions. flight attendants attentive and friendly. Plane on outward journey was 23 years old! Seats were old and tatty but nonetheless clean and comfortable. Return flight on a modern aircraft which was in immaculate condition. Comfortable leather seats made the journey more endurable and the plane was spotless.	1
PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.	1
GUW-ALA in Y and ALA-URA in C; both flights on older and somewhat stuffy 757s which however have generous legroom in economy and plenty of space in business. Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).	1
AMS-DUB October 9th and back again October 12th. Both times just after 1PM. No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far. Good value for money I'd use them again but not for a flight with a layover since (small) delays seem to be common.	1
DUB-BOS return JFK-DUB. Service was very good steward was friendly and attentive food on the flight from Dublin to Boston two levels higher to rate than on the flight home (over seasoned crab cakes and greasy) I immediately got a different menu offered.	1
BOS-DUB-BCN return. A333's between BOS and DUB were clean comfortable and had great entertainment systems. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the service was very good. A320's between DUB and BCN were clean and a little less leg room. They charged for everything including water. When boarding in BCN they weighed our carry on luggage (never had carry ons weighed on any airline ever before including the flight to BCN) one was a bit over so we had to check it at an extra 50 euro.	1
Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.	1
Geneva to HK via Moscow. Aeroflot was good for the given price. The customer service was up to the mark (eg. I didnt confirm veg meal while booking but attendant once informed remembered to bring me veg meal with a smile). I found it to be a cultural thing with the russians which you should be open enough to accept it. Things can be little chaotic at Moscow airport. Check which airplanes they are flying on given routes and make booking accordingly - Airbus they had were new.	1
GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.	1
Bangkok to Budapest through Moscow. The plane leg room and food were ok nothing too great but adequate. Entertainment is rather limited especially when you are offered the same films on the way back. Passengers were sober and quiet but they did not react security calls and moved around cabins in a random manner. A huge queue to go through a single transit desk in Moscow. One machine - a real embarrassment. Airport is a 19th Century with coffee costing £5. We needed some help with finding a gate. I approached 6 airport staff - all were abrupt rude and unhelpful (I am bi-lingual and tried both languages). Staff in the plane were polite but still no smiles as in other airlines. There were numerous delays in all locations. I have to say that the price was very good so will go again. Please smile more and show more films.	1
KBP-SVO and consider it the best option between Kiev and Moscow. I was promised 500 miles for online check in which didn't work. Airport check in a breeze. Boarding was chaotic A321 spotless with good seat pitch. Fast baggage delivery. Onboard experience was somewhat spoilt with inedible breakfast snack and young crew members who looked lost and helpless. English announcements were hard to comprehend.	1
Milan-Berlin-Antalya and return via Dusseldorf: a reasonably enjoyable experience although Berlin Tegel was possibly the worst 'airport experience' I can remember for a long time especially as I had a 4 hour layover stuck in what seemed like a make-shift demountable building plus use of a few old steel chairs. Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time). Priority luggage does not appear to be recognised. All in all quite a pretty good experience and which reminded me for the benefit of my fellow countrymen very much like some of the better Jetstar flights and experiences in Australia.	1
"Oslo-Berlin (Tegel). Boeing 737-700 round trip. Same equipment. Check in was fast both ways. We checked in 1 bag. You can have 1 free (23kg) bag checked in. Pretty much left gate on time both ways. Seats were comfortable but jiggly. I got the seat of the passenger sitting in front of me in my lap during take off both ways. Air Berlin says on their website state they will give you a free non alcoholic drinks and a Ham/Cheese sandwich on flights over 90min. We got a choice of ""sweet or salty"". Note: If you choose ""sweet"" you will get a waffle bar. If you choose ""salty"" you will get a bag of chilli potato chips. Drink choices of coke products and juice/coffee. It would have been nice if they asked if you want a ""waffle bar"" or a ""bag of potato chips"" because I was confused. An overall average flight. Left on time and landed on time. Good value for money."	1
I fly Air Berlin every 2-3 weeks long haul from Europe to Miami doing the same flights all the time. One thing that stands out is that they are not consistent. The crew (under-staffed) do not work as a tight team and so the service is often all over the place. Being a TopBonus Gold member makes no difference at all except for priority check-in lounge access and pre-aboard. I always fly economy and choose to sit at the back I usually miss a choice of meal the seat next to me is rarely kept free and the regular collection of rubbish from your seat is very poor or non-existent. I often disembark with a seat pocket full of rubbish or I take it with me to the toilets during the flight. When pressing the call button they attend to your seat turn the call button off and then a give quick glance to see if you actually wanted anything. Water is given to you in a bottle there is no mid-flight juice/water service. When boarding they have 1-2 crew members greeting passengers while the rest stand in the galley no effort to emerge and help people find seats store luggage etc. I fly Etihad frequently and am shocked at the tie-up the two airlines have - complete opposites when it comes to service. I have a tomato allergy for which I can rarely get a special meal so when boarding I ask them to make sure they put aside a meal that does not contain tomato this request is often met with no response or an attitude of that is a lot of work of 14 in the last year only once did a crew member actually give me a crew meal. I now take my own food. Have tried several times to upgrade to business class with miles but never been able too. On a positive note the long- haul aircraft is modern IFE is excellent and seat comfort is ok and they are nearly always on-time. I have flown business class a few times and they are excellent - there is however only two business class cabin crew for 19-20 people so if full I imagine service would be different when I have flown there is only a 10-12 people in business class.	1
ZRH to TXL and back in mid-November 2013. As an OW Sapphire member I was able to reserve a seat for free in advance additionally because I made the seat reservation only 3 days prior to departure I was able to obtain an XL seat free of charge which is something that Air Berlin normally does not offer its OW partner members. On the flight to TXL the plane type was changed without advance notice so I ended up with a normal seat but on the way back I enjoyed the larger legroom. I must say that if you're taller than 6'2 the normal seats are at the limit of what one could call comfortable. Though there is no pain or pressure in any way. The fare cost less than 5$ the rest made up of various taxes and fees and it ended up costing me around 120$. I like the fact that overall the service was good enough for this amount of low fare. Along with the good public transport connections in ZRH and TXL door-to-door cost me 135$. Departure was on time in both cases. Staff was friendly in both cases though there was nothing special about food and beverages being offered. No inflight entertainment at all bring your own.	1
BHX-DUB-JFK outbound BOS-DUB-BHX inbound. Outbound: BHX very quiet no queue for check-in all on time A320 clean the seat is fine for such a short flight. At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport. Overall very happy and I think this will now be my preferred route to the East Coast saves the trek to LHR.	1
JFK-DUB-NAP. Seasonal route to Naples. Outstanding product service and price. Beats any US airline. Professional pilots and FA pleasant and clean cabin A330-300 decent pitch IFE. Armrest does not raise all the way. DUB-NAP on clean A320 Sky Deli edible enough price competitive with airport. Return DUB-JFK A330 bulk seat 9D in private cabin behind Business. Cool spot IFE screen folds with armrest. DUB T2 is small and efficient transfer.	1
Air Berlin domestic TXL-DUS-TXL 737-800. Though almost fully booked on both ways boarding was smoothly (maybe due to new boarding process). Crew - as always at Air Berlin - a bit of a mixed box: varying from friendly with a personal touch to absolutely indifferent. Seat quality and choice of snacks and beverages very good for a short hop. Arrival 5 min late both ways - so almost on time. All in all good domestic product and value for money.	1
WAW-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-WAW. Flight from WAW to TXL on a new Bombardier Q400 short and smooth. Flights from TXL to AUH and from AUH to HKT on the A330-200 were half empty so it was very comfortable having 4 seats in the middle row to sleep all by myself. Same thing on the way back. Service was great as well I can't complain at all.	1
I was hesitant to book this airline going to Osaka due to the negative reviews here but it was the cheapest option. To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again.	1
