"WAW-SKJ Economy. No free snacks or drinks on this Star Alliance partner. Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water. On the way back I switched to Turkish Airlines via IST and got a free 3 course meal on both segments and friendly service."	0
LJU-FRA-LJU. Both flights on time. Flight attendants are friendly however they allowed 3 different versions of female uniforms on the same flight. A white T-shirts under an apron looks very casual for a flag-carrier. The planes are quite worn and promotional messages on the seats for an insurance company look cheap. Food is ok taking in consideration that it was just an 1 hour flight.	0
I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.	0
I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.	0
LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.	0
London to Tirana via Ljubljana Economy Class. 30 minutes late on first leg due to air traffic restrictions at Gatwick but Adria held the connecting flight for us even though there were only a handful of people transferring from the London flight. The food was adequate on both legs and the crew were friendly. All in all a perfectly acceptable journey and I would fly Adria again.	0
Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.	0
FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea  coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.	0
BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.	0
I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.	0
LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!	0
Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.	0
Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.	0
LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.	0
LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.	0
DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.	0
Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.	0
Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.	0
Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean  well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.	0
Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.	0
In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.	0
I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.	0
I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.	0
A3 930 Athens to Cairo. Service bland and erratic uncomfortable thin seats food inedible and in minuscule quantities. Gate agent checking my visa requirements for 15 minutes. A real disappointment.	0
"EI134 (06 July 15) and EI135 (27 July 15) were Omni Air International 767's with non-Irish crew. In-flight entertainment was startlingly bad in first class on EI134 (chunky hand-held viewers with three or four tepid films) and non-existent on EI135 (even fewer films and shows repeated on tiny seat-back screens hourly, as in the 1990's). There was no in-flight wi-fi, so good thing I brought a book. First class inflight meal (EI134) was good, but first selection (beef) was unavailable. Inflight meal on EI135 was positively inedible except for the roll - not even dressing for the salad. First choice of meals on EI135 (chicken) was unavailable again. Second choice was tentatively identified as ""beef"". This was a shabby performance by Aer Lingus and I have come to expect much better."	0
Athens to Abu Dhabi Business. Business class is a waste of money. There is the middle seat which is not available thus giving more room to the other 2 side passengers. No comfort seats no video system no amenities no nothing. Food was just ok stuff was kind and helpful. My advice: Beware of Aegean flights out of Europe as these are just seasonal. If they find that they have many empty seats left they will cancel the flight. I should fly Etihad economy. Its cheaper than Aegean business more reliable and has the same amenities except food.	0
Travelled with my 2 sons ages 4 and 7. Had ordered 2 children's meals and found out at service their meals weren't on board. Due to being delayed my son's went 8 hours without a meal and I had to feed them chocolate throughout the flight. Also the inflight entertainment did not show one children's movie. Awful customer service, they won't let me talk to a manager or Senior member of staff and have forced a travel voucher upon me I did not wish to accept.	0
I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers. I have noticed that many routes are operated by Aegean only seasonally so beware they may cancel your flight anytime if they see that they have not many reservations. Overall definitely a budget airline nothing more.	0
Flown this week and if any doubts left, clearly a low cost airline. Nothing for free not even water. Both planes in a poor condition with different seats. Even the announcements which are programmed were different which indicates to non homogated fleet. Flight attendants with poor attitude towards passengers.	0
Writing this on behalf of my 87yr old mother who had flown to the UK on a 6 wk trip to see family. Aegean had been informed she required a wheelchair and we received confirmation it was booked both ways. From Rhodes to London they had no details regarding the chair and had to rush around looking for one. Apart from that initial problem my mother informed me everything was fine however on the day of her return Aegean decided to go on strike thankfully they messaged although it was 10 'o' clock at night. I tried desperately to get through eventually they put her on the following day again with confirmation of the wheelchair. London section was fine she tells me and the staff were quite attentive but on landing at Rhodes I waited outside and to my disgust saw my poor mother dragging a 20kg suitcase behind her carrying a coat and her handbag! Not one staff member offered to help she even had to ask a member of the public to lift her case from the conveyor belt.	0
Arrived in plenty of time for the flight only to be told it had been over-sold. I was told I must go on standby, with no option otherwise. I was assured that my baggage would be on the next flight out (4 hours later) which I caught. On arrival in Dublin sure enough, no baggage. This is hugely inconvenient as I am away on business with no change of clothes etc. The staff at the desk were overstretched, and not very helpful. I travel a lot with Aer Lingus and I have to say that their service is getting worse each time I fly.	0
The flight attendants were very rude, and the media system was broken which didn't help an 8 hour flight. Kept asking for updates about it and the flight attendants didn't acknowledge it. They only came around with drinks once. Food was inedible, and the leg room was small even for an airplane. I've flown internationally many times before and Aer Lingus was the worst in my opinion.	0
I have travelled from Athens to Tirana every week for the past two years and I see it more as a torture rather than a journey. It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.	0
Munich to Thessaloniki. 17/10/2014. No space to place a laptop in cabin due to people with more hand luggage than allowed. Crew not friendly and not willing to apply the rules of hand luggage per person. Food below average. Drinks warm. This wasn't the first time things where not good. Would avoid flying with Aegean again if possible.	0
Boston - Dublin May 15 flight 138 - was supposed to be an Aer Lingus aircraft but apparently several days out they had to charter a plane from Omni International - which is generally used as troop transport - that was filthy crammed to the gills with the maximum seats. There went our prepaid extra legroom seats no air controls no Aer Lingus staff no individual seat TVs nothing - it was horrible and the worst part - no prior notice. Then - coming back Aer Lingus Shannon - Boston May 31 flight 135 - supposed to be a double aisle aircraft - you guessed it - Boeing 757 - one aisle - 6 hours and no explanations. Yes I understand the airlines can substitute aircraft - but (especially on flight 138) a comparable and comfortable substitute should have been made. I was appalled (and I am a regular traveler to Ireland).	0
Boston – Dublin. Flight EI136. Dublin – Naples. Flight EI450. I last traveled on Aer Lingus in 1977 as a child. The service was excellent and the food was great. So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.	0
I travel with Aegean many times during the year usually I do SKG-ATH-SKG and I usually travel in business not because of the service but because I have the ability to change flights at will online and without any extra charge. During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight. I told them that this is a business ticket and I can change whenever I want to the could not care less. Hence I have decided not to fly with them again.	0
Holguin to Havana last week. Okay apart from issuing duplicate boarding cards to different passengers. Return was in a turbo prop plane which was 1 hour late and was infested by cockroaches running along the floor overhead lockers and electrical ducts. The plane was generally dirty. Obvious lack of maintenance.	0
What a wonderful friendly airline. Flew with them Hholguin to Havana and back. Both flights only minor delays was served juice and a cake on this short internal flight safety demonstration was done.	0
We flew Dublin to Paris on May 13th 2015. From the start we were greeted with disinterested and unfriendly staff at check in. Even though I checked in with my husband we were not seated next to each other even though the plane wasn't full. I moved myself over to sit with him before take off but why would they seat us apart? The cabin crew were miserable. Finally they rush through with the tea and coffee and snacks that you have to purchase and staff didn't even bother to ask us if we would like something. The plane itself was disgustingly dirty with drink stains spilled on the seat. The back of the seats holding the magazines was vile with what looked like a mixture of spilt drink food and mould. We will never fly Aer Lingus again.	0
I traveled from Munich to Boston in early January 2015. The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.	0
Flew from Rome to Dublin with Aer Lingus on Friday 10th April. Very slow check-in with a huge queue. More importantly I can't understand why Aer Lingus make you check-in in Terminal Three and then make you walk the whole way back to Terminal one to board plane to Dublin - this is a long trudge from Terminal three through terminal two to terminal one. You would need a up to an hour to do this walk. (including long security check line). When you fly into Rome you go into terminal one and can exit there. When we finally got to gate the staff insisted on taking carry-on bags from some people (but not all) because the flight was full. In the end the overhead lockers were half empty but some people had a long wait for their luggage. Aer Lingus need to improve their ground facilities in Rome and move the check in desk to terminal one adjacent to the gate.	0
Travelled MCO-DUB with an infant. Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'. The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal. Really poor service added to an outdated seat I wouldn't recommend Aer Lingus.	0
Travelling from Athens to Santorini in August 2014. Flight was delayed. Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation. We could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from Santorini to Athens.	0
Boston to Dublin on March 18 flight EI 0138 and Dublin to New York on March 30 flight EI 0105. What a bunch of cold flight attendants. I have never experienced anything like it. A smile must cost them a million or cause them a lot of pain. Maybe it's these ugly uniforms. The service is minimal with one meal on a transatlantic flight and most of the flight you could not find the flight attendants other than in the galley. I have also never experienced a flight with so many passengers with bladder problems. Of course they don't go to the airport bathrooms to them it is much nicer to go in the plane so minutes after take-off they start to go and go and go. Make sure you sit far away from the bathrooms or better yet fly a better airline.	0
29 March 2015. I was booked to go YYZ-DUB yesterday. Flight was cancelled. I checked in at 3pm and left the airport at 12.15am after being added to same flight today. Checked in today at 3pm the line was packed with passengers enough for two flights. The staff checked in all but 9 of us who happened to be from yesterday's cancelled flight. A long time later they managed a flight to London Heathrow tonight with Air Canada boarding at 10.40 pm. I'm going to arrive in Heathrow at 11am and board an Aer Lingus flight for Dublin arriving at 2.45 tomorrow. I'm really not sure what to do when travel goes pear-shaped but Aer Lingus oversold the flights and nine of us unrelated and obviously not aggressive or over-assertive ended up in a horrendous nightmare. I've spent two day times in Pearson airport.	0
Flew back from Dublin to Orlando on a less than satisfactory airplane (previously used by Iberia Airlines). The plane was very cramped with seats very close to the seats in front the width of the seats were very narrow! My seat didn't recline at all. It was loose and broken. The staff were rude and inefficient etc.. All this hell on an 8.5 hour journey at least.	0
LHR-ATH-LHR. Flight over very uncomfortable as it was a smaller plane than usual and absolutely no leg room. No inflight entertainment which is essential for a nervous flyer. Seating comfort was better on return trip but Aegean have ceased inflight films and replaced them with extremely repetitive tourist films and no radio/music. Very disappointing. Having flown with Aegean on this route for many years I am now reconsidering.	0
"I am a Senator Gold frequent flier with Star Alliance. I bought a ticket with Aegean to Paros. It turns out that the flight is operated by Olympic Air - not a Star Alliance member - and therefore some of my privileges do not apply. I can still have more luggage but I can not use the lounge. The Aegean representative refused to issue an invitation to the Aegean lounge since ""it would cost them extra money"" while I thought I had this privilege included in my ticket bought with Aegean. Nothing about reduced privileges was mentioned when I bought the ticket. Aegean did not want to do anything to accommodate the urgent need of a passenger with a Senator Gold card of Star Alliance who had to use the internet in their lounge for an emergency."	0
Birmingham to Rhodes 5th July. Absolutely appalling. 12 hour delay with no update through-out the day. No explanation or apology when we eventually got on the flight. Once we were on the flight the toilets were locked at the front and we couldn't get past the air hostesses to use the toilets at the back. States in Aegan Airlines TC of delayed flights that we are meant to get some form of contact from the airline within 7 days. 3 weeks later we still have yet to hear from them.	0
Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.	0
Dublin to JFK. The pre US clearance actually makes the flights more confusing as you have to give yourself over 2 hours to clear that area then find the appropriate gate. This is NOT printed on your boarding card and the distances in this airport are lengthy. Business class desk woman was extremely rude and so were the 2 customer service desk attendees that I dealt with to change my flight. Internet has never worked on these flights for me my vegetarian requests have been missed 4 out of 5 times and the general level of Irish customer service is extremely low. They speak to you as if it is a privilege to pay them to fly with them. Do not fly with Aer Lingus if you need to ask a representative for anything. They are understaffed and the employees are not helpful in general. Fend for yourself with this cheap airline.	0
Swiftair instead of Aegaen Rhodos to Zurich 5th July 2014. Instead an Aegean aircraft we had to board a nameless very old White MD 83. No announcements no apologies and a 2 hour delay! Onboard I found out that it was a Swiftair charter airline from Spain. Seat comfort very basic no magazines no monitors absolutely nothing. Very old noisy aircraft. I booked through the official homepage of Aegean and was very disappointed about this awful downgrading. Nevertheless the cabin Crew of Swiftair (except one Supervisor all Spaniards) did an acceptable job. The inbound flight ZRH to ATH was one hour late. But at least it was an Aegean aircraft. My next flights to Greece will be again on SWISS.	0
Istanbul to Athens. 1.5 hour delay is unacceptable. It was my second flight delay with Aegean in just one week. Seat space and meal very poor.	0
Recently travelled to Ireland via Heathrow on ANZ then partner airline Midland to Dublin. After 2 very enjoyable weeks in Ireland travelled Dublin to Edinburgh with a party of 20 on Aer Lingus. 16 had an extra bag booked and all those were well underweight. One person had an extra bag not overweight but not booked for which the additional charge was 320 euros. This was negotiated down to 270 euros and we were advised that the charge would have been wiped had we flown into Ireland using Aer Lingus. To put the extra charge in perspective the price of a return ticket plus bag on the net that day was 119 euros. This experience detracted from our visit and does not seem a good way to engender goodwill towards the airline.	0
I was traveling alone with my six-month old baby. The first leg from London to Moscow went smoothly. The aircraft was very comfortable and there was an option of a bassinet. I am especially thankful to a flight attendant who was extra helpful and attentive to me as she saw that I was alone with a small child. The second leg from Moscow to Bishkek was much more difficult. It was a red eye 4-hour flight. I had zero help from the crew even when locating the seat and trying to manage my cranky and tired baby, and at the same time putting the carry on bag on top. The bassinet option was only available in business class. The temperature on the plane was extremely high. It was unbearably hot for the whole duration of the flight. The crew did not offer any help whatsoever. Traveling alone with a small child is a mission in itself. But there was no sympathetic attention from that crew at all.	0
"The best idea if you have to fly with them is not to understand Greek: then you will not understand the check-in staff talking amongst themselves! Also you will not understand the stewardess instructing another on the safety procedures and features of the plane (""no this is the call button it does not sound an alarm""). On the LHR-ATH flight they failed to carry out basic safety procedures like drawing back partitions and ensuring all seat belts were fastened. On the ATH-LHR leg I was informed that I had to pay an extra 45 euro for the same bag that was included in the outward ticket!"	0
"First time Aer Lingus trip. SFO to DUB (and back this is a review of both trips). Ticket was over 1000USD so I was very surprised that drinks and snacks were not free except soft drinks and a tiny bag of pretzels. I have never experienced this on an international flight before. Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while. The waiting masses were rolling their eyes at this. The seat-belt sign was on the whole trip so in the end we just ignored it. All in all I will try to avoid Aer Lingus from now on."	0
Delhi to Helsinki via Moscow.The flight took off 3 hours late from Delhi and no reason given, with the result I missed my connecting flight Moscow to Helsinki. The staff of Aeroflot in Moscow were not helpful and just gave a boarding pass for a flight departing at 6.40 in the evening and reaching Helsinki by 9.00 PM.  It was 11.00 PM by the time I reached Lahti and a large taxi fare because of the delay. Their customer redressal is poor.	0
Adding a 25% extra luggage fee to the already expensive ticket is outrageous. We traveled each with 16Kg normal luggage from Brussels to Greece and back. We carried small back packs as hand luggage. Before we were allowed to check in we were charged 45 euros for each suit case. One would think that charging 190 euros (going and back) extra for luggage is obscenely greedy.	0
Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.	0
I had a reward booking with them from ATH to LHR and on a separate ticket I had a paid ticket from CHQ to ATH. They had it as valid connection the CHQ-ATH at 17.25 arriving in ATH at 18.10 and then 19.10 - 21.00 onwards to LHR. The feeder flight got delayed by an hour resulting to almost lose the connecting flight. Upon boarding I inform the crew but they were indifferent. Finally I did manage to catch my connecting flight only because there were others delayed as well.	0
We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour. The pilot said he would start the engines to warm the plane up - the propellors turned twice! When we got home I had a query and needed to speak to Customer Service. I filled in a Customer Service form - 4 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response.	0
"Not surprising this is a ""regional"" airline and it obviously aspires to nothing better! In Oct.2013 I booked and paid for a business class seat ATH-MAN but 3 weeks ago while checking My Bookings noticed I'd been downgraded to economy. The call centre simply shifted the blame to the travel agent. The latter found out that Aegean have decided not to offer business class on this route no warning no alternatives nothing. I cancelled my ticket."	0
Rome FCO - Athens A3651 Feb 22nd. Athens - Rhodes A3216 Feb 22nd. This airline is intended to be a regular airline however it behaves like a low-cost one. You have to pay to check in a luggage in addition to the normal fare. Seat spacing is comparable to a low cost such as Ryanair quite insufficient. Food is average but more importantly it is presented in cardboard boxes which are recycled. Choice of beverages is very limited. Unfortunately Aegean is in a monopolistic situation in Greece and they are expensive and cost/satisfaction of service is below average.	0
For an international carrier it must rate as the poorest value. The audacity of them to charge for alcoholic beverages and the gall of them to recommend you spend €18 odd on what they call a decent meal when most national carriers provide the same free. I was travelling with some friends from Australia and they were taken aback by the frugality of the meals and beverages. Not my favourite airline and would only travel with them if it was absolutely necessary. As the Irish have a habit of mimicking every other country don't know why they cannot take this on board.	0
"11th April SU0260 Moscow-Tokyo. 21st April SU261 Tokyo-Moscow. Flew on a Airbus A330 from Tokyo to Amsterdam through Moscow. First time Aeroflot but never again. A list of disappointments: All announcements were in 3 languages: Russian English and Japanese even the sales and priority rewards announcements. During the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once(!) even during dinner we didn't get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. This was a day flight and I didn't sleep so I didn't miss anything I'm sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but don't let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes (and in 3 languages again). The sign ""fasten seatbelts"" was lit for 3/4 of the flight but I didn't feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didn't want people to stretch their legs. Very outdated multimedia system no subtitles available. Stewards refuse to speak English and explains everything in Russian constantly."	0
Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.	0
Tel Aviv - Moscow Sheremetjevo - Bangkok and return. Twice B777 and Airbus 330. Airbus 330 on the Moscow - Bangkok route. Not very comfortable these airplanes. Personal TV with mostly older movies. Food nothing special and no beer or wine served on any of the routes I have flown. I can understand they do not serve liquor but not even a beer with dinner. Service is average to good and friendly. Aeroflot got me on time where I was flying to. I think there are far better choices out there then Aeroflot.	0
Flew from DUS-SVO-BKK. I am at a loss of words for the unfriendly staff. We had the feeling that they were annoyed about our presence in the plane. I have never experienced such unfriendly staff in my life. In addition 4 hours late without even explaining the delay. The Inflight-entertainment system itself was not bad. I would say slightly below average but still okay. The problem were the headphones. The headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad. I would not complain if the price would have been low. But it was pretty much the same as other airlines like Emirates or Etihad. 1/10 will never fly with Aeroflot again.	0
We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.	0
Awful Aegean experience (Heathrow to Athens on 22nd December 2013): Hand-luggage with just two laptops (one of them half size) is overweight for Aegean airlines. Hand-luggage bought especially for cabin use and used in others budget airlines with no problem. They made me to empty it twice! For a ticket bought 9 months ago at a price of £ £420 for a flight equivalent to 3.40 hours. The plane was delayed an hour. I just managed to get my next connection flight to Mytilini because it operates from the same airline and they were waiting for us. Aegean has monopolised the local aviation. Also the time schedule is such that it is not worth it to get another airline and change to Aegean for the local trip only.	0
Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight. Not recommended.	0
"Aer Lingus Flight 111 from Shannon to JFK on 1 Oct 2014. We found the flight attendants to be aloof and unprofessional. Several passengers asked for different things and the flight attendants would just ""yes"" them but never followed through with their requests. It was like they were playing a game - just yes them and don't deliver. Will look for alternate airlines on future flights. I have been flying for over 30 years and never experienced anything like this before."	0
We made a reservation for 16th March 2015 to fly from Budapest via Moscow to Bangkok with Aeroflot airlines. Arriving at the Budapest airport we noticed that our flight SU 2031 which departure must have been at 12.50 was changed to 14.40 without any explication (delayed or something). We know we'll miss our connection to Bangkok so instead of arriving in Bangkok at 8.30 we were late 2.5 hours! That is why we had to call our transfer agency to not come to pick us up at the Bangkok Airport before 11 o'clock. So our short stay in Bangkok was shortened 2.5 hours!	0
I was very disappointed with Aerolineas Argentinas. The seats are very uncomfortable they do not have enough space between them vertically. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.	0
Flew Shanghai to Paris via Moscow. What a nightmare: aircraft ancient (still had ashtrays in the arm rests) torn and dirty seat covers toilet unspeakable by mid-way through the flight and the stop-over in Moscow is always stressful. Why do they make everyone disembark with all their hand luggage check the luggage through security when it hasn't been anywhere but on the aircraft since the previous security check and then make everyone get right back on the very same plane? If you are seated at the back of the aircraft then you spend your whole lay- over at Moscow airport standing in a queue to get through security. The food was almost inedible and my Chinese travelling companions played cards on the backs of the airline seats throughout most of the flight and all stood up to get their bags out of the overhead lockers when the pilot announced that we would be landing in three minutes! The cabin crew went almost apoplectic.	0
"We flew on A330 EZE-JFK-EZE seats are too closed to each other I'm 5 9 tall and had problems with my legs this is what happen when airlines prefer only profit instead of customer service + profit EZE-JFK was 1 hour delayed and JFK-EZE 45mins delayed. Ground staff in both airports terrible neither courteous nor willing to help you. My greatest concern is flight attendants: most of the cabin crew and I mean 90% were rude they got angry if you requested a glass of water or soda (even though you walk to the aft galley to do so). During dinner one female flight attendant offered me chicken or pasta I asked her what kind of pasta and sauce she told me: ""sir I'm not the chef who cooked the meals""."	0
Picked flight based on price. Flight from Miami to Buenos Aires was delayed by 6 hours and then canceled until the next day due to mechanical problem with plane. Re-booked on flight the next day. Luggage did not arrive in Buenos Aires for four days. Return flight delayed by 3+ hours resulting in missed connection. (All flights including connections on Delta were booked through Aerolineas Argentinas.) No help from Miami staff re-booking connection on partner? Delta. Ground staff in Miami sent us to the Delta counter to figure it out for ourselves. Delta would not rebook without us paying for new flight ourselves. Went back to Aerolineas Argentinas counter to find them closed until that evenings flight. Ended up renting car and driving 13 hours home.	0
19th September flight out - People were loaded on quickly and efficiently - same old problem with baggage. Didn't book a seat on this occasion so ended up in row ten which is noticeably smaller than the first 5 rows. Unbelievably the woman in front reclined her seat (its a short flight) and reduced my space even further. Plane more or less on time however landed at terminal one and walked miles to terminal 2 - no logic. 21st September Sunday flight - Queuing had been slightly addressed but loading was held back because of there only being one member of staff instead of two checking in and people just being slow. Arrived late which led to a few people having to run the length of Gatwick to get to their trains. Its about time Aer Lingus loaded people from the front and back of the planes.	0
Flight #134 from Boston to Shannon on 9/1 and Flight #135 from Shannon to Boston on 9/9. We took Aer Lingus 757 contracted by Air Contractors. The price was right but you get what you pay for. The food was worse than TV dinners the stewardesses were so unfriendly (on both flights) and the TV's did not work on the flight back so we could not watch movies. My friend took the Aer Lingus airbus and said the food was fabulous and they had a wonderful experience. We could not say the same. Next time we would take the airbus.	0
BUD-SVE-Phuket and back. Short leg (BUD-SVE): A320-200 seats are alright (Recaro seats) meal was terrible. Crew was ok. Long leg (SVE-Phuket) 777-300 (Kutuzov) poor seats no leg room very unfriendly crew (both way) the worst meals I've ever had. However this was the cheapest and fastest flight to Phuket from BUD.	0
"London Stansted-Athens-Thessaloniki. Once again although cabin experience with this airline is good check-in process seems to be its weak point. Flight departed Stansted on time but just before landing at Athens I realised that I did not have a boarding pass for the connecting flight. I spoke to cabin crew about it but they seemed unaware of any issues/processes and simply referred me to the connecting flight desk at the airport. When I got there this was shut. There was no one available from the airline either and I ended up speaking to airport security. I was told that I had to come out of the airport security controlled area and check in all over again to get the boarding pass and that this is a standard procedure even though bags get transferred on to next flight automatically. There was a queue from hell at check-in which seems to be the norm for Aegean. I have never been asked to check in twice at airport for connecting flights. This then caused problems with my airport shopping not getting through security and I had to pick up my bag re-pack and hand in again. This involved a long and time- consuming process walking up and down the airport's different floors etc. Ground staff were understanding and did their best to help but there is no two ways about it: this was a very poorly ""organised"" connecting flight. I sent a form to customer service to complain but they just said that the problem was at Stansted and that they have rectified it. I asked how they have rectified it but they just responded by repeating the same. I am not convinced. A hassle-free flight with Aegean seems impossible and the overall experience does not correspond to what you pay. I would not recommend. On the way back with Air Berlin connecting at Dusseldorf did not give any problems and was a pleasure to walk past the Aegean packed check-in area knowing I didn't have to brave it."	0
The short flight from Athens to Istanbul was delayed by 1.5 hrs making my fiancé and I miss our connecting flights back to Singapore. We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.	0
EZE-JFK. The flight was supposed to leave at 11pm. A maintenance issue on the plane but the airline did not announce a delay / cancellation until the boarding time. First the departure time was delayed to midnight and then to 2am. Finally at 1:45am they announced that flight was cancelled. Passport control was closed. Also there were no baggage claim staff. Aerolineas Argentinas decided to reschedule the flight to 6:10am (7+ hour delay vs. original time). After changing the gate and the plane the boarding started at 6.45am and flight left at 7:30am. This airline is terrible. They don't care at all about service.	0
We travelled from Orlando FL to Edinburgh via Dublin on 2 Sep 14 (FLT 120) and returned to Orlando on 13 Sep 14 (FLT 121). Both flights were the worst that my wife and I have experienced. The flight attendants were rude inefficient unprofessional inattentive and were completely aloof to what was going on around them. For example I pushed our flight attendant buzzer at least 10 different times to no avail. We were completed ignored. The food service was a farce and disgrace. One passenger wanted a blanket asked for a blanket but never received one. Another passenger asked for a cup of tea several times and after 30 mins or so it finally arrived. At times you could not even find a flight attendant. We will probably never fly Aer Lingus again.	0
Recently travelled BOS-DUB RT. Love the airline but cost cutting is making the experience disappointing. Very tight seating with poor recline. Entertainment system not up to par with other transatlantic carriers. Flight attendants were exceptionally kind and friendly.	0
Bangkok to Moscow 9 January 2015 flight 273. Awful customer service experience. The Aeroflot customer service team promised that they had found extra leg space seats as requested for my wife (dislocated her knee). When on board we found that they were not only normal economy seats but in fact were exactly the same ones that we had reserved previously (before her leg break). So not only was service unacceptable but also the staff seem to have > deliberately deceived us at the customer service and check in desks. I assume to move us on without having to do anything else. So they let the company down and of course passed the problem on to the flight attendants who also did nothing much to help. Very poor indeed.	0
I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.	0
Sunday 31 Aug flight DUB to Gatwick. Completely amazed as on time! The usual nonsense over passengers having far too much hand luggage - and despite being the posher version of travellers - not a single ounce of common sense with how to put luggage in overhead bins prevailed with the over-made up chef stewardess threatening to place a case in the hold.	0
Customer service staff at Greece Airport were generally rude and sarcastic giving different versions of flight re-booking solutions. We were told we have to pay an extra 39 euros per person due to different flight cost and when we went to a different counter we were charged 20 euros per ticket as ticket amendment costs instead. In all the attitudes of the staff were very unpleasant.	0
"Return trip MUC-HER-MUC. On the return flight from Heraklion a cramped airport check-in-area full of returning holiday-makers: as a home-airport for the airline I would expect more than only one check-in being available for two simultaneously departing flights (MUC  CDG) resulting in horrible waiting queues. Additionally all passengers including those who managed to self-check-in and proceed to a ""bag-drop-desk"" had to queue a second time to take their luggage to only one open x-ray station themselves - another queuing disaster in an already overcrowded waiting hall. In total the check-in and ""bag-drop"" process on this particular flight consumed nearly two hours in cretan summer heat. I think Aegean could certainly do better by doubling the check-in-staff (opening a second counter) and making sure that passengers can actually drop their bags at the bag-drop. Making the experience even worse was a consecutive technical issue with the aircraft resulting in nearly 3 hours of waiting in an equally overcrowded terminal airside with bad information policy."	0
I always fly American Airlines first class in my trip JFK-EZE-JFK. I decided to try the business class (club condor) with Aerolineas Argentinas. I regret to says that the business class of American Airlines is much better. The seat at the club condor are ok not flat bed but ok. We were welcomed with orange juice a cheap champagne and candies. The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast. The returning flight did not even have all three dinner options and the food was horrible as well. I wonder how do they plan to compete with such a horrible presentation. They do not provide you with the custom forms for USA.	0
"Bumped! Arrived early at the airport and found out the flight was ""oversold"" and I had no seat. Offered two choices by employee: find a ""volunteer"" to cede his/her seat or get on a later flight. Chose the later. Found out later on this flight that the same thing happened to several other passengers. And this later flight was not full, which seems to explain the ""bumping"". Maybe a wise move in a profit or managerial way, but not a great one in public relations terms."	0
Sunday 21st June, Shanghai to Mexico City Premier Class. Old aircraft with no Inflight Entertainment this situation bother me so much. There was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing. The flying experience was not be very good on Premier Class after I bought an upgrade from  economy class.	0
Went back to US on an 11.50 am flight from Dublin to Boston. Worst flight I have had. 3 out of 6 hours of my flight was spent having to listen to a toddler with his non-stop and very loud crying which the parents didn't exert much effort to stop on top of a seat that doesn't recline. My back hurts so bad. This is just one of the minor things the airline should have a regular maintenance check on to provide more comfort to their customers specially for a long flight.	0
Have flown with Aer Lingus round trip from Boston to UK 3 times prior to our flight in August. The return trip from Dublin to Boston was not what we usually experience with Aer Lingus. The flight attendants were not helpful. They were slow distributing the snack which turned out to be only drinks didn't offer anyone a snack. They did not hand out blankets. Told passengers to get them themselves. Distributed the meal slowly and it was well into the flight before we ate. Ran out of choices so we got stuck with a beef meal that was inedible. The flight encountered some turbulence so seat belt naturally went on. Yet the pilot took his time turning that sign off when the turbulence cleared. It seemed like we were confined to our seats for most of the trip. That also seemed to make the attendants happy. They did not appear to enjoy their job at all that flight!	0
Flew Business class from Tehran to Moscow Aircraft A321 clean inside no entertainment at all. Flight attendants polite but lacked professionalism as they forgot about handing out wet towels and two or three of them were sleeping in the last row of business class during this very early morning hour departure. This is simply unacceptable. The performance level by the crew was very different from what I have experienced on other sectors.	0
I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.	0
SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.	0
Ground staff were very helpful and attentive. Aircraft old/new(800). Legroom really tight, airline crew to and from were mostly inattentive and tended to spend most of the time in the galley. They were doing their job perfunctorily, devoid of any concern and hardly smiled. Staff hardly spoke English! Only drinks and peanuts on international flight! I would recommend other airlines given the choices out there.	0
Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dublin on Flt EI263. This flight was strictly ok and seemed like one of cheap airlines. It was a short flight but the passengers were very loud noisy but our connecting flight from Dublin to SFO Flt EI147 was a nightmare. After two security checks and a very slow US immigration Customs we went to the gate and the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Once on the plane it was freezing cold and there were no blankets on the seats for passengers. Cabin crew kept saying the heat would start soon but that never happened. We were travelling with kids and they were shivering. After repeatedly complaining the staff gave us some extra blankets which helped a little bit. We had ordered Hindu Vegetarian meals but we were given meals with chicken as they had no veggie meals onboard and nobody was apologetic. On this long flight we were given only one tasteless meal that the kids hardly ate and one snack bar before landing. No snacks or treats for kids during the flight. Vowed never to fly Aer-Lingus again.	0
Flew from Dublin to Palma Majorca. Flight left at 7.30am about 6-7 drunken young men allowed to board. One fellow spent the whole 3 hours of the flight yelling back and forth to his buddies swearing every second word it seemed and there were small children sitting right in front of him. Everyone around very uncomfortable. Three hours of drunken louts around us and staff incapable of dealing with them they continued to serve them alcohol. He wasn't met at the arrival gate by security like he would have been in most places. After the horrible flight our luggage did arrive but it did take almost an hour to arrive at luggage collection so not sure if that was Aer Lingus or airports fault. No onboard flight entertainment (3 hour flight would have been nice) and food was all to be paid for but that's ok since it wasn't a long flight. Flight was cheap so would recommend airline for that reason only. But the other low cost airlines we flew on were all cheap too and better.	0
Automated check in at El. Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.	0
Flew from TLV to ATH on July 21st. Long queues for check in staff seemed unprofessional. Cabin crew seems to be very tired no smile at all. I asked for 2 glasses of water after they served breakfast one for me and one for my mother they brought only one and said they would bring the second one. Nothing was brought. Meals were downgraded from hot breakfast to a sandwich that was cold.	0
AR 2467 from Mendoza to BA on 17/02. Several flights in last 3 weeks. Flights late no information staff unhelpful and couldn't even be bothered to clear the cabin. Missed one connection and took three attempts to get anyone to rebook it. Our luggage went without us. Thought Vietnam Airlines were bad but AA could teach them a thing or two!	0
Took 4 flights in Jan: SYD-EZE - no dramas other than ordinary food and lack of entertainment (a tiny central screen that is off color and barely able to hear the audio on my headphones) on a 15.5 hr flight. EZE-FTE - they changed the airport 8 hours before the flight (from EZE to AEP ) luckily I arrived early and they put me on a bus to the other airport. Delayed 30min. FTE-EZE - delayed 3 hours apparently because of storms in BA that morning but I had a 1630 flight and they never managed to catch up. EZE-SYD - delayed 16 hours initially for heavy rain in BA then they needed fresh crew then the new crew arrived late then missed curfew at Sydney airport. We waited at the airport and departure times kept getting pushed back. Missed my domestic connection but was able to rebooked the next day. At least the airport has free Wi-Fi. Staff do not care and were not helpful will never fly them again!	0
Flew to Buenos Aires from Sydney in early January and back in late January. The flight from Sydney started with one hour delay and arrived before scheduled time due to fortunate conditions. Inflight entertainment was on a central screen 2 movies ok. The food was not great but reasonable for economy. I had to change my flight by 2 days going back Aerolineas made that very expensive for me. The return flight was very poorly organised. Check in was extremely slow with unnecessary delays. Subsequently the take off was delayed 2.5 hours without explanation. The flight itself was uneventful with the aircraft arriving 3.5 hours late. Movies on board were the same as on the flight to BA and were repeated. Meals were minimal. No drinks were offered in between meals.	0
The seat assigned to me was 10C. When I got on the plane the headrest was broken and dangling down the seat back? Why had no one tried to fix it? What a splendid first impression. The toilet at the back of the plane smelt disgusting. I asked a flight attendant if they at least had some kind of spray to alleviate the stench and she grudgingly produced something and stuck her hand around the door and squirted. I have flown several times on this airline recently and the thing that leaves a lasting impression is the complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing.	0
Me my wife and our daughter were flying Sweden-Kiev-Bangkok with Aeroflot. I have really nothing positive to say except the low price. Of course we understood that we would not get much because of that low price. However we did not see the crew at all during all the flights only when the food was ready which was at really strange times we and many others on the plane were very hungry. We were served lunch and dinner on the first flight then breakfast on the second. The food was horrible. The food we got for lunch and breakfast was exactly the same and we did not had anything to choose from. The tv-screens at all seats were not working but that was not a big deal for us. We will never fly with Aeroflot again.	0
On Dec 18th we left Miami at 7 pm for Buenos Aires. Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation. We will never travel this Airlines again.	0
"Aerolineas Argentinas provide the worst customer service that I have received from any airline. One of the internal flights was cancelled due to a strike by airport staff (Puente de Aereo - Buenos Aires). We had to queue for 6 hours to speak to a representative (during a heat wave where the temperature was close to 40 degrees C). When we did finally reach the front of the queue we were offered an alternative flight for 5 days after the original flight date and were not offered any compensation in terms of a snack or alternative accommodation. Their attitude throughout was ""it's your problem"". On our final flight back to Bogota they changed the flight time from 6.30am to 5.20am around a month before the flight. We turned up 3 hours before the flight as instructed on the ticket only to find no check-in staff present. We waited 1 hour before a single representative turned up and when I asked why staff weren't present to check us in at the time that we were requested to be there I was told ""it's very early"". This was another example of their attitude towards customers. As a result the flight was delayed by 2 hours. In conclusion the customer service levels at Aerolineas Argentinas is a joke."	0
Sunday flight 19.00 17/8. I dread going home with Aer Lingus as there is usually a scrum to get on the plane as the regulars do not understand the meaning of the word queue and the staff don't control the amount of luggage each passenger takes onboard leading to the ritual scratching of heads when their oversized hand luggage doesn't fit in the overhead locker and delay as bags have to be stowed. Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.	0
Firstly do not be tempted to sit in seats 31 E D F G or 29 A C H I on the Dublin to Boston route the Aer Lingus website will not show that these seats do not recline. I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.	0
"First and last time I will fly Aer Lingus. Returning from New Zealand I flew Air NZ Premium Economy to SFO (normally I go All Air NZ AKL to SFO/LAX to LHR-Belfast). However this trip I availed of Aer Lingus' new service from SFO to DUB to cut out a flight. Seats were incredibly cramped and uncomfortable with very small seat pitch and minimal recline which the passenger beside me commented on also as they boarded. Food was utterly disgusting my alleged beef Stroganoff actually tasted worse than it looked which was no mean feat I didn't even attempt a 2nd mouthful. Wine was extra $5USD. For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean ""breakfast"" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out. The whole experience just felt like a cost-cutting exercise. IFE was average/poor small selection of mostly dated material. I would advise anyone going for a long haul fly out of London on one of the better carriers."	0
I traveled with my children (9 and 5 year old) from Sochi - Moscow - LAX. My experience was horrible. I nicely asked for good seats because I was with 2 children. The worker answered that she could not help me because the computer chooses the seats. Given seats 35K 35G and 35H. At first look it seems normal but when we got to the plane it was shocking. One seat was window side the other two in the middle row. Where is the logic? Where is the common sense and customer care? This was a 12 hour flight.	0
LHR to ATH 5th June 2013 at 22.15. Disappointing - having booked online an emergency exit seat this was changed to a normal one at the back of the plane on which another person was sitting. The cabin crew were inadequately trained to handle my complaints appropriately.	0
I was booked on flight AR1893 USH-FTE 2nd Jan 2014 departing at 13.35. Arrived at the airport at 12.00 facing a long queue due to problems with check in system. Around 45 min prior the flight departure while still queuing for check in they announced our flight cancelled. They made us wait until 19.00 to tell us that we had to come back tomorrow for more info. We were given no food not hotel organised. Staff at the airport were arrogant refusing to speak English to non Spanish speaking customers and uninformative. Never again!	0
I was on the inaugural flight to Buenos Aires from JFK and while the service at the airport was great and went through without any hitches the service on the flight was horrible. The flight attendants had such a bad attitude and passengers flicked on the service light for the entire flight and not once did I see someone respond. They basically served dinner and then left the cabin for the entire time until breakfast. I was dehydrated and not feeling well and wanted some water and didn't see anyone come so being that I was in the window seat I flicked the service light and after an hour of waiting I finally went to look for someone all the way at the back of the plane and they were all sleeping (it was 7pm). It was such a bad service experience that I will sadly never fly again and recommend that no one else fly either. You have one chance to make an impression and they really blew it with me.	0
"I traveled to Buenos Aires from Miami on the 8.30am flight on 12/21/13. 5 hour delay no explanation. The cabin was dirty pieces of sticky food on the small video screen. Numerous AR employees and ex employees meandering around the business class cabin socializing with flight attendants and members of the crew certainly not helping the already poor service they were delivering. Multiple FAA safety violations. Example: people standing while the aircraft was moving luggage obstructing the pitch during take-off and landing etc. Service was awful. In addition to leaving 5 hours late it took them 2-3 hours to serve the first drink. When they finally came by with drinks I ordered a whisky. The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was ""bothering"" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was ""defective and reclined too much"". The whole point of paying for business class is for the seat."	0
"Our flight on July 31 was a very poor experience. Passengers on flight 661 from Vienna to Dublin were left stranded at the gate for close to two hours past the posted departure time. Monitors in the area claimed the flight to be on time. There we absolutely no Aer Lingus or any other airport employees in the gate area during this time. The security personnel-the only non passengers we could access - refused to assist the passengers as we all became increasingly frustrated at the lack of information. We made phone calls to the Vienna airport (they must share the blame for this debacle as well) and Aer Lingus. No one offered any help whatsoever. Aer Lingus has apparently trained their employees to respond to any question or concern with a very irritating reply: ""We understand that you are frustrated"". This is all we heard from Aer Lingus employees throughout this flight. Not one Aer Lingus employee responded with appropriate action. At check in we were promised help with a seating request that I had tried to manage multiple times before arrival. No help was ever provided. The hot meal was frustrating as well. Many passengers were left with no option for the meal. This is no way to respect paying customers. We will avoid Aer Lingus in the future as it is apparent that they are in no way interested in appropriate customer service."	0
Berlin SXF - Dublin on 31st July another delayed departure due to passengers bringing oversized wheelie bags into the cabin and then struggling to find space and in some cases lift them into the overhead lockers. I saw one lady bring on a case large shopper and two large plastic bags! I had checked in a bag and placed a duty free bag in the overhead bin asked to remove it and place it at my feet so a passenger could place a large case in there - flatly refused. This is not the first time this has happened and ruins an otherwise usually pleasant journey compared with the other main airline operating out of Dublin. Come on Aer Lingus get tough with those bringing on excessive amounts of baggage and stop trying to penalise those of is who pay to check in luggage.	0
Madrid - Santa Cruz B747-400 economy. Checked in at Palma okay on connection but no through booking for seats. Check in at Madrid and Aerosur cabin luggage allowance less than originating airline (through ticket) so cabin bag removed and put in hold. Entering plane strong toilet odour throughout the cabin. Generally a very dirty cabin interior with hard uncomfortable seating. No inflight films available. Bar service once glass of wine and water. Cabin staff said they had run out. Dinner was a greasy stodgy rice. I've got my return to look forward to - and all for £1450.00 return. Awful - I do this trip 3 times a year and nobody else treats passengers like this.	0
Santa Cruz to La Paz. The flight we were booked on was cancelled two days in advance and we were switched to a later flight. This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight. The aircraft was quite old although not as old as some others we saw - they still use 727s for some flights.	0
Took seven domestic flights on Aerolineas Argentinas during December 2013. Of the seven one (Salta to Buenos Aires) was cancelled but postponed as a new flight the second (from Buenos Aires to Trelew on the same date) was cancelled and the passengers left on the airport overnight for 10 hrs. There were no announcements and the new flight never appeared on the board. We were given a chance of free dinner at a pizza place on the airport but no hotels. We foreigners pay more than twice of what locals pay!	0
Traveling with my children from NY to Córdoba via Buenos Aires. The NYC-EZE flight was delayed more than 8 hours. Luckily they emailed me before I set off to JFK airport. The problem is that they forgot that we had a connecting flight and did not make any provisions at all. Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time. They don't even bother to pick up the phone. In summary: only fly Aerolineas Argentinas if no other option is available. They are unreliable have no customer service whatsoever and will not hesitate to leave you stranded. And never expect an apology.	0
I suppose my experience is similar to other reviews. Our outbound SFO to MEX was great on a 737-800 with footrests and plenty of room. The return tonight was awful. The legroom on business class required my wife to climb over the center console to get out of her seat. The flight attendant came by to offer a drink and slapped down my chicken dinner which was cold. He never returned for two hours to refill my water. They kept the galley curtain closed and he sat and was playing a video game most of the flight. I such a shame when you are a full fare business class customer. Airlines should be required to uphold a certain standard and inform the passengers.	0
"We have been flying with Aer Lingus since 1999 and until last month we always considered it our favorite airline. The flight crew and planes have always been first rate and the food while never great was at least passable. On our flight (EI-111) from Shannon to JFK we were served a meal that was quite possibly the worst we have ever been served on any airplane. We opted for the chicken ""dinner"" that came with some sort of rice as well as something called ""Spicy Salad"" if I recall correctly. The salad was inedible. If this is the type of food we can expect from Aer Lingus in the future I can assure you that we will be looking for a different carrier on our next trip."	0
Zero: contact their reservation/sales desk by sending 7 emails in Spanish and English. To this day I never received any reply of any kind. Still don't have my reservation code so still unsure if my reservation exist. Have not travelled yet so can not rate on board experience.	0
Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.	0
La Paz - Sucre in an ex-Mexicana 727. Ticketing process is manual and very slow - beware and get your tickets before the airport! We were handed a little snack bag as we boarded then served drinks on board - a great way to provide good service on a short flight.	0
Sydney-Buenos Aires-Rio: AR1181 and AR2254 on 26 Sep 2013. Rio-Buenos Aires-Sydney: AR2255 and AR1180 on 11 Oct 2013. Really bad. Flight was heavily delayed from Rio to Buenos Aires and I missed my connecting flight to Sydney. Meal awful old plane with no inflight entertainment staff very rude. Avoid at all cost better pay $500 more and go with a trusted company.	0
The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency in the airplanes. Flew MEX-CCS- MEX a couple of times in business class in an old wear out 737-700. Shared TV screen seat that resemble the old American Airlines business class. Then I have flown GDL-MEX in the 737-800 what a difference. Service is nice they treat you well but definitely they need to vamp up the Clase Premier Product.	0
"ATH-Santorini-ATH. A320/A321. In Athens check-in OK but boarding was extremely confusing with rude staff (overbooking even for pax with boarding cards. i.e. connecting passengers were refused boarding). In Santorini check-in at 7am completely mad people queuing outside of terminal no ""Gold star Alliance members"" check-in line plus a clear favor for local travel agencies and their pax. Unacceptable."	0
AeroSur has become the leading Bolivian airline after the breakdown of Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB). VVI-CBB-TJA. Checking in took about forever and the Aerosur ground staff forgot to mention airport tax that still had to be paid. This was mentioned by security officers with only 15 minutes to go. We still made it on time despite the lack of help of ground staff. TJA-VVI. While checking in I was offered to take a flight right way or two hours later. I choose the latter but was refused because the luggage guy had already tagged my suitcase for the early flight. Of course they couldn't get it back. Again total lack of service of ground staff. The flights were ok albeit not on time. Flying in these countries is never on time. Despite all this I would certainly choose AeroSur next time but only because there's no reasonable alternative.	0
The flight from Sydney to Buenos Aires was awful - the food was disgusting the toilets were not cleaned for hours - hence the smell. No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas. I would not recommend that you fly with this airline I certainly will not.	0
"LHR-SNN 17th June 2014. I used to travel Aer Lingus on this route quite regularly however since experiencing the leg room on the A319 I see no reason now to chose Aer Lingus over Ryanair when travelling from London to Shannon. I am 6'1"" and I literally could not fit my legs in to the seat. Luckily I was in the aisle however kept having to squeeze my legs in when the trolley came past. I am aware these are former Iberia aircraft hence the reason for the difference between the leg room in the A320 and the A319 however I feel Aer Lingus should have reconfigured the A319 to provide a consistent product between aircraft. I travelled in row 7 on the outbound leg of this journey (which was the former business class area for Iberia) and had more than enough leg room. Beware of travelling in the rear of the aircraft on the A319. Very unpleasant flight and I just about managed to put up with it for the hour duration of this flight. I could not imagine sitting in these seats for any longer."	0
By far the worst airline I have flown. Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight. For the price I paid spending a few more dollars to fly with a competent airline with modern planes would be completely worth it.	0
Belfast City to Heathrow on 24 May and return on 8th June A319 both ways. Found the seats hard and the leg room constrained compared to several flights of similar length on Bangkok Airways A319 in late May/early June. Would not like a three or four hour flight on these aircraft. Would only recommend if no alternative unlike EI long haul which I consider good.	0
BHX-DUB-JFK. We booked Aer Lingus because it was the most cost-effective option to New York from Birmingham with a short connection time. I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.	0
SU2584 SU262 and SU271. Out April 4th back April 17th. Preferably I would never use Aeroflot again - expensive queues at every stage slow miserable long faced staff videos on board out of date food poor.	0
I traveled with Aeroflot last December going to Bangkok via Moscow and the same return trip. The aircraft cabin was not clean on all of the 4 legs I traveled the cabin crew were rude and unhelpful food inedible and on two of the planes the TV radio and reading light were not working. I will never use Aeroflot again.	0
I booked a flight to Lagos via Tripoli. We had delays at Gatwick but once in Tripoli we were told to wait two days for our connecting flight to Lagos which - totally unacceptable. We stayed in the airport from early Mon morning until monday evening stranded without any local currency and offered refreshments approx 11am. After a lot of protest we were put on flight approx 8pm that evening. This was my first experience with Afriqiyah and will be my last - despite the savings it wasn't worth the terrible experience. The lack of communication in Tripoli was disgraceful and =on the plane the staff were curt.	0
"Return trip - Sao Paulo to Puerto Vallarta connecting through Mexico City leaving October 9th and returning October 14th. One day before departure I received an e-mail informing me that the return flight was postponed from October 14th at 23:15 to October 15th at 08:40. Since I had to be back in Sao Paulo on the 15th in the afternoon I contacted Aeromexico in Brazil to request that my return flight be transferred to TAM who code share with Aeromexico on this segment with the flight leaving Mexico City around 20.00. Aeromexico told me that the notification must be a mistake because they see no changes in their system and all flights are according to original reservation. As proof they even sent me a copy of electronic ticket which really showed all the correct departure times. Also checking the Aeromexico site there was no indication of any delay. So I forgot all about it until one day before my return flight when I got a Trip Reminder e-mail stating again that the return flight was now at 08:40 on the 15th instead of 23:15 of the 14th. I again contacted Aeromexico this time in Mexico and again they confirmed that everything was according to original reservations and they had no information about any delay. After using Aeromexico's online check-in system and receiving electronic boarding passes with the correct time stamped on them I felt somehow reassured. My mistake. When I arrived at the airport to check-in my luggage I was informed that due to ""unscheduled maintenance"" the flight would be delayed by 10 hours. Unscheduled Maintenance? Really? Either Aeromexico's computer system is totally screwed up and they have no idea of what is happening with their schedules or they simply are lying to their passengers to avoid having to transfer tickets to other airlines. Whatever it is it is totally unacceptable!"	0
Our return flight to the US from Edinburgh was not a good experience. We waited in line 55 minutes while one employee handled baggage and check in for the flight. While she assured us that we would make the flight it was a harrowing experience after we arrived at the airport 1 hour and 20 minutes early. At the gate one employee handled boarding and she had to check a number of bags because the overhead bins were inadequate for a typical carry on. We paid extra for upgraded meals which were terrible and I hate to think what those that did not upgrade had to eat. The attendants from Dublin to Orlando were no shows except for the meal service and a laughable cookie snack. I would never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.	0
Airbus 330 Dublin to Orlando June 17th 2014. The A330 would be comfortable for a trip that lasts 4-5 hours tops definitely not as long as 8 hours. The Dublin to Orlando journey was very uncomfortable the seats are far too narrow the leg room is a minus and the arm rests are far too narrow. All in all a horrible journey. The flight was very smooth. The air hostesses were abrupt while trying to accommodate everyone. I will think twice before I book another long flight with Aer Lingus.	0
Moscow-Bangkok-Moscow. Departure from old and dark Terminal F in Moscow. Boarding started about 50 people went to the jetty when they stopped everything due to broken galley on board. We were strangled inside the jetway for over 30 mins with no info at all. Couldn't get on board and they closed gate doors so we couldn't comeback to the gate. Horrible service. Flight itself was ok nice 777 but 10 seats abreast is too much on such a long flight - too cramped and not comfortable. Crew were very young tried to smile few times and be nice. IFE was good. Food acceptable but very small portions. No alcohol was served at all. Return flight without any boarding problems. Food much better than from Moscow but no choices were given at all. Young crew didn't smile even once quite poor English female FAs looked very nice and groomed but male FAs looked like some cheap bar workers - all ties untied buttons of shirts were left opened really bad view. Not impressed at all. Generally I wouldn't recommend Aeroflot for longhaul flights as service is quite poor crew inattentive and very cramped cabin but they offer the quickest connection from Western Europe and day flights which saves a lot of time.	0
Pretty average flight Sydney-Buenos Aires. No seatback screen food OK. The return flight BA-Sydney was poor. The same movies were showing as 5 weeks previously! The food was awful. The service was ordinary. Nobody appeared to have checked the toilets for about the last 8 hours of the flight - no toilet paper full bins - disgusting.	0
Firstly the take off was delayed with no announcements when we asked at the desk they just said 'we will go when we go'! Once on the plane we noticed it is empty so we had extra space but it looks like they failed to clean properly my table was covered in food smears when I asked for a wet towel to wipe it off I was told to 'just relax man just chill'! It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death  murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.	0
I read all the bad reviews and decided to take a chance anyway. I had three tickets to Mexico from two different places. On all three tickets and on two separate occasions they changed the flights and added a ten hour layover. They said that they would fix it by asking me to leave a day later. I booked through Expedia and they would not help. I was on the phone with Expedia and Aeromexico for at least two hours. They did offer a refund but by this time all the fares were at least $250 more. I had to cancel all three tickets and rebuy on other airlines at an extra cost of $750! Their schedules mean absolutely nothing - and certainly don't book on anything that requires a connection.	0
Munich to Thessaloniki and back into Frankfurt as part of a connecting flight to/from Heathrow that was actually booked with Lufthansa. Cabin experience was good even though there was no space in the overhead lockers both ways and I ended up storing the bag under the seat which meant reduced legroom. Service on board and catering acceptable but nothing special. Food good but service disorganised and one FA asked the customer to remind another FA to bring him water! Check-in experience was the worst with a huge queue and people trying to barge in. When I raised this with staff at bag drop-off they didn't seem bothered and said they would rather use capacity for the actual desks. Overall customer service on the ground was not great. In future I am going to avoid this airline as would advise you to never try to book a flight on their website. This is meant to confuse and rip you off. I have been booking flights for my own use and for work and have never encountered such an error with the flight dates before. This is a low quality airline charging high fares.	0
Crew dreadful food cold - delays from start to finish on outbound and inbound. Tripoli is the filthiest most hostile place and staff bully passengers especially female. We were delayed for 8hrs and no one would help. They all smoke in the no smoking areas the toilets have to be seen to be believed. Brand new planes are good but there the value stops - it is just not worth the saving on flight costs.	0
Very disappointed Aer Lingus cancelled our flight from Dublin to Boston on May 30 and treated us very poorly on the rescheduled flight on June 2nd. I am in full support of the labor action by the crew but I will never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone. We were not seated together so we could not help each other with our bags and the crew could easily have rectified this at boarding. A six hour flight sitting eight rows apart! This was not necessary. We paid over $500 in extra expenses because of the strike and the best the cabin crew offered was an extra cup of tea which was very nice but not quite enough. Avoid Aer Lingus.	0
Athens to Paris Nov 5th. Waited for 2 passengers for 35 minutes. Caused us to miss the Paris to Chicago connection by seconds. Aegean flight crew alerted halfway through the flight that we probably wouldn't connect in time and again as we left the plane. No help from them no one was available. Our group of five college educated adults couldn't find any directional signs whatsoever in Paris airport. We could only hear our names being called to board. We reached the gate in time to watch our flight take off. Had to spent the night in Paris. Filthy plane dirty seats badly worn carpet.	0
Miami to Buenos Aires. The cabin service was a disaster staff treated passengers in a disrespectful manner. Is only worth flying with them if you need leg room and have to take extra luggage. Seats are in a bad condition amenities - many of them do not work at all and the selection is very poor.	0
Using the Manchester-Shannon route weekly when it 's working it's great and staff are good - but reliability is patchy and when things go wrong Aer Lingus customer service is dreadful to non-existent. Last week reached Manchester 6 hours late following an unscheduled stop at Dublin. Technical difficulties again! No sense whatsoever of Aer Lingus trying to minimise the effect on passengers. They need better more reliable planes or much better customer service or perhaps if it wouldn't be too much to ask both!	0
SU106 SVO-LAX Jan 11 2014 on A330-300. This was some older version airplane I was seated in row 16 in a broken seat and virtually with virtually no legroom. Comfort absolutely inadequate for a 13 hrs flight. After takeoff we were told that we had to land in Oslo to refuel. This turned out to be a 2.5 hrs stopover since no one was informed about our landing and need for fuel. In fact Aeroflot used the opportunity to change the crew so it is very possible that this was the actual cause for the unplanned stopover. All together we spent 16 hrs in that plane and of course missed the connecting flight on DL airlines.	0
We traveled with them over this past summer and had a day delay and then when we finally got to Moscow the connecting flight was difficult to find. They changed the gate at the last minute and didn't make an announcement. We unfortunately missed our flight because of this and they weren't sympathetic at all. Mind you we had a toddler with us and I was 7 months pregnant. It was awful. We had to pay for a new flight and didn't give us many options. I will not be flying with them again.	0
My flight was overbooked and I was forced to stay in Brazil for extra 3 days. Staff at Rio airport are very rude. No apology from staff for not having a place for me and my son to return to Sydney. I also lost time at work which I was not paid for. All of this for choosing to travel with Aerolineas Argentinas for many years. I now will travel with any other airline never Aerolineas Argentinas again.	0
We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.	0
Sydney - Buenos Aries 19th March 2013. Quite the worst business class flight we have experienced. Only good things to say about it is it arrived safely on time after a 13 hr.	0
Dakar-Tripoli-Gatwick. Fantastic seats and legroom. Food was good as was in-flight entertainment. Friendly efficient cabin staff. Late departure but arrived on time. Price lower than alternative carriers.	0
Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene	0
Dubai - Tripoli - Dakar. All in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks - the spare seat next to me also helped. It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying. Very cheap and comfortable.	0
London - Tripoli - Accra. Have to say that in both directions a pleasant and trouble free flight. Onboard catering was fine and Coach class seating exceeded standard specs both pitch and quality of seats. New aircraft but remember that this is a dry airline so no alcohol available. Overall I would be happy to fly with them again.	0
The airline has improved since I first started travelling with them4 years ago. The airplanes are new food is great seats comfortable and staff are improving. However the baggage service is a big disgrace. At the airport in Mali the service is useless and at the office in Bamako they cannot tell us anything. So until Afriqiyah can improve this I will not be travelling Afriqiyah again.	0
NY to MX City to GDL - My flight was delayed 2 hours in NY but arrived on time to MX City to catch the connecting flight to GDL. However received an email telling me of the 2 hour delay and my flight back to NY was cancelled. Called the airline and was told the cancellation was a mistake. When time to fly back to NY as scheduled I show up a the airport to be told my flight was cancelled! They could only offer me to fly out by 1am from Mx City to NY or rebook my flight for the next day. Booked the flight for following day and again my flight from GDL to MX City was delayed which made me lose my flight from MX City to NY and had to wait 9 hours until 1am to take the next flight back to NY from MX City. Plus Mx City Airport need to increase their WiFi Service. I was stuck for 9 hours totally bored with no WiFi good service. I was so disappointed because I had liked AeroMexico before and never had problems but this time I noticed their great service has declined. The only thing I thank them for is the food vouchers I got to get free food from any vendor at the airport. However delaying your flight makes a big difference in your entire day and getting home terribly tired with no sleep.	0
Flight #128. Mexico City to Guadalajara. 7/26/14. When we arrived we were told the flight was oversold. Our seats had us next to each other on our original boarding passes we were separated because someone decided to fly a smaller plane. Our original tickets were for placement on a larger airplane. We boarded the plane. We waited on the runway for almost 2 hours. Every time someone needed to use the restroom they were told to sit down. Nothing was offered during this time. Finally the captain came on and said we had to return to the gate. He said we couldn't take off because of a maintenance issue. We got off the plane got our luggage and were told were told to go to the ticket counter. At the ticket counter we waited for another 2 hours. We asked if staff could at least provide some water and they said no they didn't have any. Unacceptable. We waited another hour until we were finally given a new connecting flight some food vouchers and a hotel room that we napped in for only 2 hours before we had to be back for the morning flight. I do not recommend flying with them.	0
My father and I flew from Lima to Mexico City on the 767-300ER. When we were checking in the agent told us that the flight was delayed 50 minutes. We passed security and went to the business lounge until 1.45am - the time we were told to board. We made it to our seats only to wait 5 minutes and they told us there would be a delay of 3 hours so we didn't board until 4.30am. We went to our seats 1A and 1B. The width of the seats was uncomfortable but they do recline almost 180°. Service was awful. They only served the food no drinks offered and food was either salad or chicken. No AVOD and even not a movie during the 6 hour flight the TV was shared. We arrived delayed in Mexico City. Overall I do not recommend business class it is not worth the price.	0
Flew from Tokyo to Tel Aviv via Moscow around December 4th. Flight from Tokyo was pretty good. From Moscow there are no direct gates so you have to take a bus to board the plane. Waited 10 minutes inside the bus while it was right under the plane already. Another one and a half hour inside the plane before they drive us back to the airport and gave us 400RUB (gets you a coffee). Overall the flight was late by almost 6 hours on a 4 hours route. From Tel Aviv the flight was late by about half an hour. Upon landing had to board the bus again. It drove for about 20 minutes to the terminal. My bags didn't arrive to Tokyo (because the connection was too short). Will never fly with them again - it was cheaper by less than 100USD but definitely not worth it.	0
"Lyon to Oran. Two Airbus A320 are mainly dedicated for operations between Lyon ad Algeria. I would allow that the service tends to decrease. I can't stand how Aigle Azur operates ""charter planes with high density configuration for regular flights between France and Algeria. It is unbearable to get sat so tight in those seating rows impossible to move or eat correctly."	0
Travelled LHR-ATH Business Class then ATH-JMK (Mykonos) all Economy. Flight boarding was fine seats the usual European system with centre seat left empty and centre of the seat folded down to form a table. Was offered pre take-off drinks i.e. half a plastic glass of orange juice or one inch of sparkling white wine again in a plastic glass. The drink service was equally mean when ordering a glass of white wine less than half a glass was offered. The meal service was chaotic with only the female cabin manager looking after the 15 B/C passengers. We were booked through to Mykonos with an hours transit time (not enough). We landed and were put on a bus to the terminal then clearing immigration (bags booked through to final destination) we joined the horrendous queue for security through to the domestic flight. The queue took 40 minutes and we made the connection by the skin of our teeth. Not a very relaxing way to start a vacation. On the return flights JMK-ATH was fine only taking 24 minutes. The flight from Athens was full 16 Business Class Passengers and again the service and the quality of the food really let Aegean Airlines down. The cabin crew on both International sectors were out of their depth service was slow and mean in quantity and quality. The return main meal was the worst we've ever had on an aircraft ever.	0
SYD-EZE no online check in a real mess at the check in even though Qantas were doing it. Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese? No online check in but their adds tell a different story.	0
My husband and I recently travelled on Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aires. There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?	0
Gatwick to Accra. I was not disappointed with the quality of service - time seat cleanliness entertainment and food. Each section of the trip proceeded smoothly and I felt comfortable. Whilst the airline was superb I was disappointed with the toilet facilities at Tripoli. On both the outbound and the inbound flights I have never seen an international airport with deplorable and unhygienic toilets like the ones I saw in Tripoli.	0
Ouagadougou to Gatwick - the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am  departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didn't know what to do with me - I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me  upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.	0
I travelled London Gatwick-Tripoli-Douala with Afriqiyah recently. Arriving 4 hours late at 01.00 hours I discovered that my luggage and that of most of the other passengers was not on the plane. I could get no information from staff at the airport but was told that I would have to wait until Monday for the next scheduled flight to see if it was forwarded. With my schedule completely ruined and no change of clothing I had to book a hotel at my own expense and wait till Monday. I spent most of Monday at the airport trying to get information without success. Finally at 22.30 I was reunited with my luggage. Some passengers on that flight also did not get their luggage. I will not be using this airline in future even if it is still the cheapest deal.	0
Gatwick-Accra-Gatwick and found the journey up to expectations. On time both directions and the onboard staff very attentive without being fussy. The let-down was Tripoli airport on arrival from Gatwick: very scruffy and down-at-heel and staff bullying passengers into line for us to obtain Boarding Cards for the Tripoli-Accra leg of the journey. Information was less than brilliant too. The return transfer was a better but that's probably because I knew what to expect! Afriqiyah Airways are good value in my opinion.	0
"The plane sat on the tarmac for an hour (flight attendants even went through the safety announcement) before the pilot announced a problem with an engine that had to be tested. Another hour passed while they tested the engine. We then had to ""deplane"" because they couldn't fix the engine. We were herded onto another plane and they took us yet again through the safety procedures. Then they proceeded to offer us tea and coffee for which they charged 2.5 euros. Because of the delay I missed my international flight by half an hour. Nevertheless the flight attendants insisted all those with connecting flights go to the terminals where their flights had already left. I spent 3.5 hrs trudging through Heathrow trying to get home. Finally after going through security 3 times in one day I arrived back at the Aer Lingus desk at terminal one. They gave me a voucher for a hotel that they told me (and wrote on the voucher form) was in Terminal 4. It was in Terminal 5. Another hour of trudging around Heathrow trying to find the hotel. The new flight I was booked on did not leave for 24 hours. Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Never travel with Aer Lingus."	0
I travelled from Amsterdam to Cork on the final leg of a code-share Business Class flight with KLM from Osaka Japan. The difference of the inflight experience between KLM and Aer Lingus was incredible: the Aer Lingus flight was actually an endurance. Indifferent cabin crew and no service whatsoever without paying. The only good thing is that KLM assigned me an aisle seat on the first row allowing me to disembark quickly when the flight arrived at Cork Airport.	0
Flew the DUB-ORD route. I was disappointed with the movie selection offered by the in-flight entertainment. Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap. Overall I was disappointed with the flight given how much Aer Lingus charge for a one-way. I'll try another airline for the return journey.	0
"Flight from HKG-SVO-DUS-SVO-HKG. From HKG SU213 with new Boeing 777. Comfortable seat food ok. Served wine Staff friendly. Flight on time. Flight SU2436 to DUS delayed 40 minutes with no information. Boarding and check-in in DUS for flight SU 2537 and SU 212 very poor. I'm a Skyteam priority passenger from China Southern Airlines Aeroflot don't accepted the ""elite plus"" card same. No invitation to the lounge I had 1 kg excess baggage - not accepted. No requested seat for all flights. Aeroflot is am Skyteam member but does not follow the Skyteam rules. In Moscow Airport access to the Lounge but no priority Boarding. Seat in A330 a little small. Entertainment ok. Flight on time. The ticket fee was steep but service and own rules should be improved. I will not use this airline in the future."	0
"Our plane was not in order after 3 hour waiting within the plane without electricity a/con and water we were told to leave the aircraft. Our flight SU 2461 from Paris to Moscow has been cancelled. It was night time and CDG airport had been closed. Two hours later we were back to the departure hall (through customs receiving baggage back etc). It was 2.30am. They gave us a hotel until 8am. We were told that Aeroflot would send another plane the next morning to pick up all passengers. But as usual it was too expensive for Aeroflot. Instead of another plane they started to check-in passengers on ""free"" seats for other Aeroflot flights. It was 7 hours of chaos. No one from Aeroflot was there no order no food no water. At the end we were checked in (with 13hr delay) but our baggage was left in CDG. We received it end of next day only. No simple ""sorry"" from Aeroflot no compensation etc. Will never use this airline in the future."	0
Have flown Paris Orly to Oran return several times over the last three months. Whilst there have been some delays this has not always been due to the airline. Air crew seem extremely helpful carrying children and baggage to seats etc. Overall service much better that I would have expected and a generous luggage allowance.	0
SYD-EZE-SYD. Only use AR to get from SYD to EZE if you can't avoid it! The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation. Contrary to a lot of the other reviews I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.	0
Sydney-Buenos Aires. We arrived safely which is about the only good thing I can say about this flight. The first time a crew member smiled was saying goodbye as we left the plane. No IFE to speak of no drinks (water) offered after dinner no snacks lights turned off and staff disappeared. Breakfast was cake and very cold solid bread roll. Very poor. Not looking forward to return flight home.	0
London-Tripoli-Dakar returning in June. Much better than charter flights from Paris or charters to Gambia. Very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient check-in I was told I could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minute.com only said 23kg. Entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of Koran. Staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks. Food all Halal and more'real than that served on 'western flights' but the same on return. Delay at Gatwick but they held all connecting flights in Tripoli. Planes modern and clean. Staff helpful and responsive in Dakar in changing return flight for under £50. Good cheap way to get to West Africa. This is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs.	0
Have just flown to and from Tripoli. They were late leaving Gatwick on the outward journey due to missing passengers and luggage having to be removed but check-in etc was fine although we only had hand luggage. We returned on a new A320 Airbus. We left Tripoli on time and touched down at Gatwick on the dot. The service was fine and the food was acceptable.	0
We flew back Feb 22 towards our destination which was Los Angeles from Guadalajara Mexico on flight 784. We were told there was haze over LA and we needed to land in Tijuana Mexico to re-fuel and allow it to clear up. After sitting in the plane at Tijuana for 1 hr they told us the plane was no longer going to fly to LA so we could get off and figure things on our own or fly back to Guadalajara and be on standby for flights back. We were supposed to arrive in LA at 9.45 it is now close to midnight and we're stuck in TJ. The flight attendants did not try to accommodate us while waiting. They sat in the back on their phones. We waiting for at least 45 min before we were allowed off the plane then waited an additional hour for our luggage. At the airport there was no help and no assistance. We actually had to have family drive 4 hours to pick us up and I have 2 small children with me.	0
AMS-SVO with KLM and SVO-BKK on A330 flight number AFL270. The airplanes are good however the transit service is really poor this might be because of the airport it is hard to figure out your flight gate and it is complicated to get information from the staff. Waiting hours are awful I expected to get some sort of cabin or something upon arrival but sleeping on the floor buying your own drinks is about it. I won't fly a non direct flight with Aeroflot anymore it's not worth the money you save.	0
We flew LHR-Athens return. Outbound on a fairly new aircraft was acceptable; about average for economy in terms of seat meal and entertainment. Return on a much older smaller plane was ghastly. Seats were tight together like budget airlines and service to match; not a serious national carrier. We were delayed 2 hours on the tarmac at Athens. That was beyond their control but they did nothing to alleviate the discomfort. Children crying cramped seats all taken. It is at times like this one sees the true quality. If all goes well as on the way out it's OK if not and you are on the older planes avoid!	0
Flight 636 on Sunday 2-23-14 (MEX to ATL). In Mexico City they wanted to weight my purse and wanted me to pay 2 kilos extra. Why do I have to pay if my belongings were under my seat? They don't accept dollars just pesos. I have never travelled on an airline that would weigh my carry on luggage or personal purse. The customer service reps at the airport in Mexico City were rude. Flight attendants were nice and helpful. I will never travel with Aeromexico.	0
"ATL-GRU via MEX. Thought I'd found a good value on a business class ticket that would let me earn skymiles. Wrong! I flew in business both ways but only got skymiles one direction because of the ""class of service"". (The leg where I got stuck in the middle seat is the one I earned miles on.) ""Middle seat in business class"" you might be saying? Why yes. Not the seat I reserved when I booked but the seating chart at that time didn't even show a middle seat. Would not recommend don't plan to fly again myself."	0
Tiniest most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced! If you are tall forget any leg room or comfort! Unfathomable why arm rests do not totally lift up to increase possible passenger comfort! The chicken curry was frankly awful. Crew were more interested in socializing with each other than providing passenger service. There were times that the crew area sounded more like an Irish pub - loud and noisy! And then there is the fact that for all connecting Aer Lingus flights you must be re-screened for airline security! It took us an hour to clear Chicago security in order to make our connecting flight so allow additional time for this glitch! Aer Lingus may be a cheaper ride but I will not travel with them again!	0
First the entertainment system did not work both coming and going-making a very long flight. The windows were dirty with grease marks from prior passengers. I requested vegetarian meal six months earlier but was told they did not have any and received 1 small salad and cup of fruit for meal next meal - nothing! The flights also took off late for each leg of our destination. Although price was good I would pay more for another airline that had working equipment and clean plane.	0
Roundtrip from Dulles International Airport to the Czech Republic stopping in Moscow. Dissatisfaction is the word that came to mind repeatedly during these series of flights. The food was excellent. Served on time and hot on each of these flights. Very consistent. The cost was excellent compared to other airlines offering the same trip. It was downhill from there. Of the total 4 flights required to make this trip zero were on time. Every single flight left late. This is clearly a normal practice for this Airline based on my experience. The initial flight to Moscow from Dulles (10 hours or so) had no working video displays for entertainment. There was working music but the headphone connector on the seat was shorted and would barley play sound in mono and only if held in a certain position. After landing and proceeding to the terminal in Moscow there was complete chaos. The airport appeared to be clean and new with lots of English signage however some of the people working in the terminal seemed to be avoiding anything that resembled being helpful. Most seemed to have attitudes for some reason. Russian passengers herded like cattle to the tiniest security checkpoint area that I have ever seen. There were 4 lanes for 300 people. The return flight was worse. After I reached Moscow from the Czech Republic there was more herding to the security checkpoint. This time a customs representative sat at a desk near by reading a book as a few hundred people waited in lines that barley moved. I asked the person reading the book if I was standing in a special line or something since the signs were not in English she responded that I should find another line in a tone that indicated the I was disturbing her. I eventually wasted an hour before I discovered that I was in the area of customs for domestic flights and not international. The International flight area took 3 minutes to process. This theme of herding and poor manners played out at every airport except for the final destination back in the US. I will never fly Aeroflot again. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.	0
The servers were very professional and efficient and the planes were good. Our flight out of St. Petersburg was a disaster due to the lack of communication and inattentive flight representatives. We were booked on a 6.30 am flight to Moscow and were finally rebooked for a 2.40 pm flight. We were at the airport at 4 am and the plane left at 3 pm - that's 11 hrs in the airport. We missed our connection from Moscow to NY finally arriving in Orlando with no luggage. It was a nightmare.	0
I flew ATH to Corfu on full A320. Aegean are a world class airline as far as domestic flights are concerned but I was very disappointed with service on this flight. Due to Business Class being full 5 rows of economy didn't get served a refreshment at all on the flight. This is very poor cabin management. The crew were taking their time fully aware that they'd never get the service done. Even thought it's just a drink it left a very poor taste in my mouth from a PR perspective especially when they tried to blame bad weather.	0
My  flight on 1st June from Algiers to Lisboa (Portugal) was a nightmare. The check in was extremely slow and the sequence of spot check was complicated. All forms were in French and fortunately I knew some words, but most of the guests got confused. The aircraft was very old and food was lousily prepared. The toilet was like a public non-cleaned toilet for years. Seats were not comfortable and some could not be reclined. But the captain and crew were nice, particularly since they knew I was from Vietnam and they talked in both french and english nicely. Appreciated when they found the lost wallet of my friend.	0
Los Angeles - Mexico City - Cancun / Merida - Mexico City - Guadalajara - Culiacan - Los Angeles. Staff not terribly helpful. I was initially booked on Los Angeles to Mexico City via Hermosillo with only a 45 minutes connection in Hermosillo. Was told by the staff at check-in they were not sure if that is sufficient time for me to make the connection but they would not change my flights because that's the way the ticket had been issued. In the end they changed it because the Los Angeles to Hermosillo flight was overbooked. Guadalajara to Culiacan departure was late so along with a couple of passengers we missed the Culiacan to Los Angeles flight. All the announcements for the late departure from Guadalajara was only in Spanish though when asked one of the flight attendants would occasionally kept me updated. Passengers were given the option of flying via Mexico City arriving about 12 hours later or to continue on to Tijuana and making our own way to Los Angeles at our own expense. Check in was very slow on all flights. Seems that for most of the departures in Mexico there is a system for printing your boarding passes at the machines in the airport but even then the queue for bag drop itself is at least 1 hour long including in Mexico City. The domestic lounge in Mexico City was reasonable. Hot food station (soup) was manned by staff. Was not particularly impressed by how the waiting staff asked for tips twice (once before serving the soup and once after serving the soup at the counter) when all they are doing is their job.	0
"Flew the new 787 in business class from Paris to Mexico city on Dec 19th. Flight attendant refused to speak English. Served dinner about 45 minutes later than in economy class meal was lukewarm. Exactly 5 minutes later she showed up again noticed that I was still eating and asked me if I was done. The reason became clear right after desert was served. On this 12 hour flight there is only service in the first 2.5 hours and in the 90 minutes before landing. 8 full hours there is no flight attendant no drinks no snacks. They expect you to sleep and not bother the flight crew. If you can't sleep it will be a long flight. Entertainment is very limited. Movies in the section new are at least a year old. You have about 10 to choose from. Watching out of the window is prohibited by AeroMexico. The windows will be darkened 15 minutes after take off until 5 minutes before touchdown. Service was better in economy class on this flight. Expect AeroMexico business class at the level of ""Premium economy class"" on any other skyteam airline. For sure not worth the extra money."	0
Honeymoon's are supposed to end nicely! Not with Aer Lingus being 2 hours late to Chicago and missing all flights back to Los Angeles. The ladies who work there are so unhelpful. They made us run to a flight that was taking off in 20 minutes and gave us a voucher to a holiday inn if we don't make it. Of course we didn't make it! We had to go through security all over again! Their phone lines go down at 9.45 ET which means when we call after missing the 8:05 flight to LA they're closed they put us on an infinite loop hold! Flight and airport wait time total was 14 hours! Now we're just stuck in Chicago and wouldn't have been if anyone would have put in any real effort in to get us home like putting us on the 9.25 flight that would have given us plenty of time to get to the terminal from international. Instead of doing what was right they did what was easy. Truly sad and disappointed in the customer service of Aer Lingus.	0
We travelled from Manchester to New York via Dublin. On the way out the TV's were not working they reset them several times and still didn't work. Food was very poor so advise taking a sandwich with you. Loads of free pretzels for some reason which were horrid. No choice of snack and a very small orange juice break. Coming back we had paid for an upgrade for our seats we were shocked to find ourselves in the middle row of the plane no where near our allocated seats. Complained to air hostess who said they had changed the plane so therefore had been downgraded. No compensation and certainly no refund. Eventually after 2 months complaining we got our upgrade money back no compensation for the stressful flight home though. Also on the way back the movies were constantly interrupted with news of Aer Lingus charity work and asking for money. I had no issues donating the rest of our dollars but would have done so without being asked 10 times.	0
"I've been to Ireland 6 times in the last 10 years and have always flown Aer Lingus. The first time was lovely then United Air got involved and things went completely down-hill. This last trip was horrid. I don't know how anyone could find the seating even close to comfortable. I weigh around 108 lbs and was traveling with my 145 lb brother the seat felt like concrete. Like one of the other reviews I have to sit on the pillow. These retro- fitted planes are the pits. The seat in front of me was 12 inches from my nose (the screen was basically in my face.) The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was ""large and in charge"". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible. My brother needs a cane for walking and were with the other handicapped to get on the plane on the return flight. Unfortunately we ended waiting 20 minutes in the cold ramp thing (can't think of the right term) that leads to the plane while cargo was being loaded. That's right cargo not luggage. Yep the people who need canes and walkers were standing around for 20 minutes. As for the entertainment it didn't really matter since I can't look at a screen that's right in my face."	0
Had a scheduled flight from Algiers to Annaba at 10.30 and a return flight at 17.30hrs. Algiers to Annaba 4 hour delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Annaba to Algires 2.30 hours delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Old and dirty planes FA's neither friendly or helpful. Ground staff very unfriendly did not speak English either.	0
FCO (Rome) - EZE. The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.	0
I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them! Pretty bad service is an understatement.	0
Oaxaca / Mexico City / SFO. After my last traumatic experience with AeroMexico I am not looking forward to my next trip next week. This really is the last time I will fly with them - going to pay more for United flights that go through Houston. It was amazing to read some of the reviews below that mirrored my experience. I missed a $150 flight and had to pay $600 to rebook! No sympathy. I was there at the gate 2 hours early so it wasn't that I was late. I hadn't got my passport stamped by immigration because I didn't see the table and even though I was told I had time to go get it stamped and I ran they closed the gate and I missed the flight. All the employees I dealt with were very cold and even seemed to take pleasure that I had missed my flight and had to buy a new ticket. There are so many bad reviews here that I hope others will refrain from using this airline until they adopt a more user friendly attitude.	0
"3/4/2014 flight to Dublin. 3 of our group were flying from LAX and one was flying from Denver. Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was ""well you weren't on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal"". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can't spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom. Bottom line never again and I would not recommend Aer Lingus to anyone."	0
21/2 9pm EI249 Friday evening Gatwick flight. Usual appalling slow boarding due to passengers having too much hand luggage and no common sense. The seats were smaller than Ryanair and for some unknown reason tilted so it was like we were going to be launched into the sky. The whole flight was extremely uncomfortable and hot. Out of interest can Aer Lingus passengers not count as they seem to have trouble working out where their seats are? Also one case and one piece of hand luggage seem to be interpreted as one case and ninety five bags.	0
Flight Paris CDG - Algiers. Flight was more than 3 hours late and no explanations were given by the Air Algerie ground staff. The aircraft was old and very dirty. Food was still on my seat. Cabin crew were very unprofessional and not friendly at all. Food was ok. Only one toilet was in service. I will never fly again with Air Algerie.	0
They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.	0
ATL-MEX this was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I was on time (1.30pm for a 3pm flight) at the check in counter and was sent to another counter Delta. When I was turned away there as well and sent back my flight had been closed for 5 minutes and nobody could help to get me on or even rebook me to the next available flight. After being stuck at the terminal for over 5 hours hanging on the phone with travel agent and Aeromexico I had to leave home again. I was told to go the next day to the check in counter where I again was told to pay a penalty to get rebooked. I redeemed my skymiles and booked another ticket.	0
Flew London to Mexico City no entertainment on 12.5 flight! Very uncomfortable no footrests and not a lot of space. Staff on the way back were rude and impertinent when I asked for a 3rd glass of wine (thimble sized) we were curtly told that we would not be served drinks for 9 hours and that you're only allowed 1 or 2 drinks which is new to me. Staff seemed reluctant to do any work and viewed it more of an inconvenience than their actual livelihood. My seat didn't recline so spent 10 hours on an overnight upright. Food was rubbish as well.	0
MAN-DUB return. Outbound delayed an hour due to problem with something in hold and had rubbish on floor when boarded return delayed almost an hour due to knock on delay. Attendants were nice both journeys.	0
DXB-ALG. 4 hours delay without explanation and they didn't give us anything for this. The aircraft (A330) was pretty old the bathrooms were disgusting and the plane was dirty! Very poor service on-board and cabin crews are not professional. The food was not appealing. The overall service was very poor!	0
BRU-ALG-BRU. Both flight were late - more than 4 hours on the return flight. Food on board is average. The plane was not very clean and looks old. Personal friendly but not very helpful in the airport.	0
London Heathrow to Algiers on an old 767. Cabin crew are simply not professional food wasn't appealing and toilets were filthy.	0
Flew AKL-EZE/AEP-GIG-AEP/EZE-AKL. Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.	0
Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.	0
SYD-AKL-BA return. Very old aircraft untidy and looked quite dirty. No personal entertainment unit. Surly cabin crew with very poor service standards. Hardly saw FA's for the entire flight and no effort was made to prepare the cabin for landing. I also took an internal flight with this airline from BA to Ushuaia. On this flight the service was just as bad and my seat was broken. I will never use this airline again.	0
MTY to CUN via MEX. MTY to MEX flight was delayed and they didn't do anything about it so I missed my connection to CUN then customer service gave me the run around and tried to charge me MXN$300 to put me on waiting lists for flights they clearly knew were oversold. Aeromexico left me stranded in the airport overnight and couldn't be bothered to offer board and a meal. Hadn't it been for my helpful travel agency I might as well been left there for 3 days until my returning flight to MTY. MEX to MTY was delayed as well as apparently the crew was stuck in TIJ. I'll never fly Aeromexico again.	0
"Horrible experience with missed connection. My arrival in Mexico City gave me 1.5 hours to catch my connection to Merida. Our flight was on time so I expected to be ok - but quickly saw that I had a long wait in Customs. It took over an hour to get through that line-up. Carried my bag as fast as I could up to the area where connecting flights were to drop bags off - and to another line-up. The rep working there told me it was too late to catch my flight to Merida. It hadn't left but doors were closed. She told me to go and get a new flight across the hall. When I arrived there the rep told me that I must buy a new ticket. I was shocked. No other airline has ever made me pay for a new connection when I have been held up in a Customs line-up. Even the supervisor on shift would not bend. I could not believe this airline would treat a customer so badly. I had run as fast as possible between customs and baggage check-in - only to be told by the unfriendly agent that ""1.5 hours is enough time"" to catch my flight. So I paid for a new ticket - no choice! What stung even more was the feeling that AeroMexico just didn't care what happened to their customer arriving alone in a strange city. Never again."	0
MEX to CDG in a 767-200 that was at least 25 years old. The business class seat was not working well and there were no in-seat monitors. The service attitude was not pleasant. The stewardess greeting people at the door were not even smiling. Overall poor quality especially considering that the price paid was the same as the price of an Air France flight which I took on the way back and was incomparable.	0
CPH-DUB flight delayed for 3 hrs. Check-in agents said it was due to bad weather in Dublin crew said due to maintenance problems. I understand they wanted to do quick turnaround but the plane was filthy full of rubbish on the floor seatbelts not folded seat pockets not emptied etc. Inflight magazine was glued with chewing gums so it was impossible to read it. Crew announced they don't have any hot meals and sandwiches left from previous sector so only snacks and drinks were available to purchase. Crew did their job but nothing more. Sad low cost- like flight even though it cost 280 Euro.	0
I like to fly with A3 but the last flights (CFU-ATH-MUC) were the opposite. Since we were flying back home to ZRH we wanted to have all boarding cards. But for some reason we only got them until MUC. When I asked the lady at the check in she said Sorry I cannot help. You have to organise yourself in MUC. On both flights the flight attendants wanted to be somewhere else but on the flights. The food this time was inedible and the service awful. For a glass of water I had to ask 3 times and when she finally brought it she just rolled her eyes. I am not sure if I will fly with them again.	0
ALG-MRS. 3 hours delay and no explanation. Only drinks were offered for this 1hr 10mins international flight. Flight attendants are really not professional.	0
We had a scheduled flight from AEP (Buenos Aires) to Resistencia. When we checked in we were told that the flight was on time. Just before boarding time we were told that the flight was cancelled. We were told that all flights were full for 3 days but they would work on something. Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia. We received nothing in compensation - no vouchers for food hotel or transportation - and not for lack of persistent trying. We did not even receive transportation cost for travel from Corrientes to Resistencia! We would never recommend this airline.	0
Business Class return Sydney to Sau Paulo. Great price but pretty basic for the class paid. Worst was the return trip my agent had booked the ticket and I hadn't noticed that the flight home via Buenos Aires landed and took off from different airports. I thought they would arrange transfers - wrong. After much complaining they arranged a transfer with another bus company. We were lucky but others (including a mother and small child) got no guidance and had to get taxi's.	0
Tonight I went to the airport to board my flight from SFO to Cancun. I got there in plenty of time and had 2 bags to check. Their website clearly states that the first bag is free and the second bag is 50 dollars. When I got to the ticket counter the agent told me that the flight was fully booked and they were only accepting passengers with one piece of luggage. They were not accepting a second bag even if you wanted to pay. I asked them what I could do and they said I could board the flight but only if I left one bag behind. Forcing passengers with more than one luggage to give up their seats on an overbooked flight so they could solve their over booked flight without any compensation. If you ever take Aeromexico don't assume you can just pay for an extra bag. You can take 2 bags but you may have to either leave one behind or get moved to another flight. I let them move me to a flight the next day. I had to take all my luggage back home lugging it up the stairs because the escalators weren't working. No More Aeromexico for me.	0
LAX to MX City was ok but seat old and lumpy. First trip to Mexico and employees could have been more welcoming. Mother 71 not feeling too good had to make several pit stops as we were misdirected twice to our gate but we still made it 20 minutes before flight time. Not good enough gate was closed and we were sent away. We stopped at what was supposed to be Customer Service in time to hear another couple being harshly criticized for not being at the gate an hour before flight time and forced to buy new tickets to get to Cancun. My mother was so upset and didn't want me to have to buy more tickets but they knew I had no choice. This was the start of our trip and they knew it! On our return flight people were walking onto the plane minutes before the doors closed and the engines started.	0
BOG-MEX MEX-CUN CUN-MEX MEX-GDL GDL-MEX MEX-BOG. I booked a multi-city including 2 international flights and several domestic flights I can say that the only good thing about Aeromexico is their business lounge. Onboard the aircraft its a complete nightmare service is the worst I have had seats are dated and not comfortable inflight entertainment is poor and food is awful. I would strongly advise against flying with them.	0
EI 178 Dublin - London 27/12. Original flight cancelled. No staff at gate to provide explanation. Eventually rebooked on EI.178 which was delayed a number of times and departure gate changed on each (4) occasion. When this raised with staff response was rudeness. Flight eventually left 4.5 hours late (missed London train connection and had to book into Heathrow hotel). No food vouchers provided despite wait. On board aircraft no sandwiches available despite 4.5 hour wait in terminal. Had to pay £13.50 for tea ham and cheese 'toastie' and separate cheese/biscuits. Most of 'toastie' overcooked/inedible separate cheese and biscuits soggy unpleasant and also inedible. 'Use by 'date on toast is wrapper 5 days past expiry. Complained: £10 refunded. Raised matter with purser before leaving aircraft. Argumentative patronising and risible response. One of the worst overall travel experiences I have had - and will never fly this airline again.	0
Bad weather at Dublin airport. Flights understandably delayed. Aer Lingus and DAA give no information for hours. Then load us on the plane with no information. Then pilot advises we have no baggage loaded and no catering loaded and has no idea when it will be loaded. So welcome aboard sit here for hours with no food and no departure time. We know the weather is bad why not have the courage and customer service gumption to communicate with customers and explain what is happening.	0
NIM to YUL. Planes were new and clean (B737-800 and A330) on time crew was friendly and helpful. I had a stop in Algiers for 5 hours the staff at Algiers Airport were friendly too. A very good experience and the cheapest prices. Reading experiences from others it seems like I was lucky.	0
Algiers to London the flight was fine save for the lack of information in English. Lunch wasnt great and the toilet was messy. Aircraft was a newish 737.	0
I have decided to give up on Air Algerie after waiting nearly 3 days for a flight from Heathrow with 2 small children. The airline is a joke - you have to wait at least 3 hours before they tell you your not flying. We had 2 pay for my 2 young children nearly the full fare and then was told to give up a seat as they had overbooked. I am not from Algeria my husband is though - Algeria is like my second home. I feel that the Air Algerie gives the country a bad name - it should pull its socks up and start following the other airlines.	0
I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London. I think Air Algerie provides better food than BA but the FA on the BA flights project a more professional image.	0
Horrible food hot plane (and I feel the cold) seat didn't recline. No personal IFE had to watch a tiny screen at front of plane one movie wasn't in English. Didn't see staff much so couldn't get drinks. All flights delayed at both Auckland BA for 6 hrs each. Given measly meal voucher at BA that bought me nothing much. BA Airport was horrible and staff unhelpful. I had no personal effects for 24hrs once I arrived in Rio. I flew them to save $1000 over LAN Chile whom I will fly with next time and just spend the extra.	0
Flew Sydney to BA via Auckland return plus BA to Lima return. Except for BA to Sydney no onboard entertainment and food inedible. Cabin temperature ranged from acceptable to unbearably hot. Service non existent. Flight from BA to Sydney both seats could not be reclined so spent 14 hours sitting upright with seats in front reclined. Managed to change seats in Auckland. Only positives were flights were close to being on time and baggage came with flights.	0
GVA-DUB A330. Consistency is something Aer Lingus need to figure out. After a recent flight it has me irked. Outbound my designer coat had to be bunched into a ball by a very abrupt FA and put up top for take off due to it not being secure. Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine. The only reason I find a lot of people use IE is the route monopoly. I try fly with connections to Dublin when I can but something I have to subject myself to the unfriendly FA's and chaotic boarding and late arrivals.	0
14 May 2013 JFK - Moscow flight SU 103. 30 May 2013 Moscow - JFK flight SU 102. Round-trip to Moscow Russia Boeing 777-300ER JET. Boarding delayed an hour with no announcements. Team was doing an excellent job but air conditioning system was terrible. There is no personal ventilation like before now there is only central air blowing from above or from the side. On the outbound it was like a sauna hot and stuffy complains didn't help. On the way back freezing air was blowing onto me complains didn't help again. Will try to avoid them.	0
Flight G9301 at 14.25 11th October 2014 from Kiev to Sharjah was delayed for 20 hours due to technical problems with aircraft. All passengers were seated at the aircraft during 5 hours without any food at all! We got beverages twice only. During that passengers had to listen to captain's promises about departure every 20 minutes each hour. Before flight cancellation captain told the passengers that the aircraft was fixed and ready to fly but the crew were out of hours. After disembarkation baggage claim procedure was unorganized and horrible. We spent a night at the hotel and departed the next morning.	0
London Gatwick to Casablanca Flight 30106 30105 11/1/2014 18/1/2014. I was very disappointed to hear from the crew that the airline did not supply them with any copies of the on board sky cafe menu or food menu. The only thing we were been offered to buy or eat was a choice of disgusting chicken or cheese sandwiches! During our return and only 20 minutes before landing that my daughter found a copy of the menu under her seat full of delicious hot and cold meals snacks pastries candies and drinks that were all available but hidden from passengers!	0
LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine. I enjoyed the BA experience more on this route for the quality of the product onboard.	0
I have never experienced such a horrible trip. I was surrounded by 3 children all under the age of 6 who were screaming and yelling through the entire flight. They had toys on the floor and swinging from the chairs in the hallway of the plane and I was stuck in my seat not even being able to use the bathroom. The stewardess did not do much to stop the yelling because it was beyond her. By the time my dinner reached me it was cold and tasteless - last but not least my earphones did not work so I could not hear the TV monitor and had to also pick up trash that was stuck between my seat. Never again.	0
The service is a shambles! I have travelled with Air Algerie more than 6 times since July 05. Their systems need to be modernised! No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight! The price you pay is extortionate in comparison to what you receive!	0
What a disappointment! Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!	0
I'm an Algerian living in Ottawa Canada. I fly with Air Algerie every two years for my vacation to Algeria. I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.	0
First 6 hours into the flight from Argentina to Sydney - no food or drinks offered to passengers. Audio didn't work food was horrible lots of trays given back full. Staff had little or no courtesy bad movies with the TV screen flickering at all times.	0
DFW to Cancun Mexico with a stop in Mexico City. Boarded our flight to Mexico City from DFW at 06.50 in the morning after sitting on the tarmac for 40 minutes the pilot informed us that we would need to return to the gate. Once at the gate we sat for about an hour and reboarded and left for Mexico City. We had to catch a connecting flight to Cancun we had 30 minutes since our flight had been delayed so much they ended up moving our flight time to depart from Mexico City to Cancun 10 minutes early. Directed to the counter to get on a different flight. I was very disappointed in the airline and the staff out of the 4 flights there and back that we took I may have had 2 nice flight attendants. I had packed my bags to carry on and had made it on the 3 flights down and the one from Cancun-Mexico City without having any issues but when I went to board the flight from Mexico City to DFW they informed that I would need to check my bag because it was too big I thought nothing of it and assumed that it was just a packed flight but once we boarded the plane was practically empty with 5-7 overhead bins still open and my bag would have fit with the dimensions in all I was very disappointed with the airline.	0
New York JFK to Bogota Colombia connecting through Mexico City. Aeromexico sold us 3 round trip tickets with one of the connections being operated by another airline (Avianca). I was traveling with my 2 small kids ages 5 and 6. At departure in JFK their system failed printing only 1 boarding pass for the connection MEX-BOG. Asked to go to the local Aeromexico ticket counter in Mexico City to pick up the missing boarding passes with the promise someone was going to have them ready. Forced to leave the connecting area at 5am (after a 5 hour flight) dragging my 2 small kids and luggage. In Mexico City at the Aeromexico ticket counter we were met by a supervisor who refused to print the missing boarding passes claiming my problem was with the second airline. I spent 45 minutes trying to find the other airline. They did not honor any of the seats booked together when the tickets were bought and separated my kids from me on one of the flights. Unfortunately they own a monopoly in Mexico.	0
Went on a holiday to Ireland bag booked through from CPT to DUB then on the return from DUB to CPT the check-in lady said her system does not allow her to book the bag through to CPT. I have travelled this route for 10 years and have never come across such nonsense. As a result our family will never use Aer Lingus again. However it seems that it depends who you end up with when checking in a disgruntled employee can make your experience with Aer Lingus a nightmare.	0
We booked to fly from Dublin to Gatwick. Aer Lingus was the only airline flying this route on that day so I had booked them as opposed to BA. We had some extra baggage so I went ahead and booked an extra bag ahead of time for 15 Euro. When I got to the airport I was told that although I had booked and paid for an additional bag I was still only allowed the same baggage weight allowance for one person (20kg). I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase an extra bag without wanting extra weight. I assumed I would be allowed 40kg when I booked the extra bag but I was still only allowed 20kg which would have been the same weight as if I had not booked the extra bag. I am sure that a lot of other passengers fall for this! In all fairness Aer Lingus is a good airline to fly light. They have very competitive prices if you travel light but it can cost you your shirt and pants literally if you are over weight. I almost had to pay 300 Euro in over weight fess. Fortunately the staff at check in allowed me to manipulate the items in my luggage. I carried three coats in my hang on the plane and adjusted items between my luggage and hand luggage.	0
I've been flying Aeroflot for several years into Mongolia as there are no other convenient flights from Europe. 90% of the time they either can't make the connection are delayed and/or lose the luggage. I find it remarkable that I have to pay for this kind of service to fly for work - flights into Mongolia are not cheap.	0
After booking my flight from Casablanca to Gatwick one month in advance I discover today that my flight tomorrow has been moved forward 6 hours. Had to get alternative flight on Royal Air Maroc. No reason for alteration of flight time and no help or suggestions. First time I have booked Air Arabia and the last time.	0
Air Arabia from Stuttgart to Marsa Alam and back. Service is pretty much non existEnt and only a major case of hunger made the onboard meal edible. On the return flight takeoff was delayed about 3 hours no information as to why was given to us. As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff. During this time the crew had better things to do than hand out any water or other liquid refreshment it seems. I shall not be flying with this airline again if I can help it and shall recommend to all I know that they should avoid it.	0
ATH-LHR with A3. Unfortunately some items in the A3 package continue to deteriorate. I booked my flight 3 days prior to my trip. It was expensive and I thought that the flights would be full nevertheless the flight to LHR was at 65% and the return at 85%. Inflight catering its a joke. Frozen pasta and a very small salad. No water service on 3.5 hour flight. The crew are very efficient but there is no interaction all you see is frozen smiles. Baggage delivery takes a life in LHR and half a life in ATH. Both flights well ahead of time but what's the point if you wait 45 minutes for your luggage? Big problem is that BA has almost the same problems and there is no third alternative on ATH-LHR route.	0
Positives : Food quality. Recent efforts to renew the fleet. Crew friendliness Non-smoking restrictions (though I'm a smoker I consider this a plus) Negatives : Delays (too frequent). Transit lounge (poor comfort). Business  First Class lounge (poor comfort as compared to other airlines). Hygiene on board (dirty WCs sometimes even dirty seats). Inflight entertainment (non-existent). Seating allocation (non-existent). Algiers airport duty free shopping and facilities (poor standards). One of the most expensive airline for $ per distance.	0
The Air Algerie fleet is totally renewed they now have brand new A330 on international routes safe and clean all flights are non smoking. The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes. I recommend this airline yet I would like to see them adopt a world class frequent flyer program.	0
What I don't understand is why AIR ALGERIE is not allocating seats when people check in. This creates a big confusion. It is not the passengers fault but it is the airline which doesn't allocate seats. It wasn't used to be like that in the past.	0
My wife and I use Air-Algerie twice a year to go from London to Algiers and we usually use the company for internal flights as well. I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight. I do advice people to fly with Air-Algerie but remember to be a good passenger and you will see how will be treated.	0
My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.	0
MAD-EZE return plus 6 internal flights. Seats a bit worn but everything else OK. Internal flights a nightmare due to constant delays and cancellations. Due to cancellation they paid for 2 free hotel nights + dinner. When we decided to skip one of our destinations there were no sales people available to make the change. The change was done by check-in staff who were very friendly but clueless. It turned out they forgot to delete the one leg thus the system counted us as no-show and cancelled our tickets for the flight back! Luckily the plane was half empty so they could re-activate the tickets at EZE.	0
London Gatwick to Dublin on 15/11/2013 AE 249 - 9pm flight. Friday flight - delayed yet again due to Aer Lingus passengers taking their time to get on and off the plane. People again had too much hand luggage and the ground staff were forced to place some in the hold. Late take off due to passengers being selfish and hogging the overhead bins and generally being thoroughly stupid with regards to the basics such as sitting down quickly and being able to count from 1 to 29. The crew found it frustrating and its credit to them they kept calm during a very unnecessary delay. I'm finding this behaviour very annoying and am going back to Ryanair who at least make the effort to be on time and their passengers don't push and shove like Aer Lingus passengers.	0
The service and food was adequate considering we got a good deal on round trip flights between SLC and Dublin. Rather it would have been a good deal if Aer Lingus didn't end up charging my $521 for two more tickets to return home. After getting a little lost in Dublin we arrived at the airport with a little over an hour before our departure time. When we tried to check in at the kiosk it said check-in was closed. The attendant directed us to the check-in desk. They told us check-in had closed 15 minutes ago. When I pointed out that there were no lines at security and that an hour would still be plenty of time to get to our flight they still refused to let me check in and sent me to another desk to find another flight. The frustrating thing was I presumably would have been allowed to check in on the kiosk if I had been there 15 minutes earlier but I still could have had to wait in line to check my bags. That was not the case. I was able to walk right up to the desk because the airport was not very busy. When I went to the customer service desk we still had 55 minutes before our departure. Told they could get us to the U.S. that night but we'd have to find our own connections but she was not willing to quote the price of those other options. As it turns out it looks like Aer Lingus sold our seats out from under us. Yes I suppose I should have arrived earlier but I've made long haul flights before with less time to spare. Not a good ending to our honeymoon.	0
My wife my daughter (infant) and son travelled to Goa by Air Arabia - Dammam-Sharjah-Goa. Air Arabia did not provide the Bassinet for my infant even though it was mentioned in the E-ticket. My wife requested the crew to provide the Bassinet but they did not help her to provide this.	0
Heathrow-Athens. A huge line for baggage drop with only 2 Aegean employees to check-in the entire flight. A problem with the baggage belt added more waiting time and frustration. Staff were really snappy and rude. Due to that delay there was a 20 minute delay in boarding and departure. The plane was really hot (the air- conditioning did little to help). Finally when we arrived in Athens we had to wait an extra 20 minutes for bags to start coming out on the belt. Overall an unpleasant travel experience.	0
As it's the only option in Algeria I travel twice a month with Air Algerie and I can’t tell lots of things need to be done within the company itself for instance all Personnel need to have a worthy training to learn how to treat customers to improve their poor service quality.	0
I fly sometimes with Air Algerie and it is not worst nor better than all other flight companies. For the security all the airplanes in world are submitted to the same safety constraints so it is not more dangerous to fly with Air Algerie than to fly with others (All Air Algerie airplanes are from the last generation Boeing or Airbus). And the greater decision Air Algerie has taken is to eliminate smoking in their airplanes. For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.	0
I am an Algerian living in London I used the the service once from London it was the most expensive horrific and time wasting in my life. It was the first and the last it took me 9 hours where it should have taken only 4. I complained to London branch manager but no action followed nor an apology.	0
As an expat living in Algeria I frequently have to use the services of Air Algérie for going on business trips. As a frequent user I can only confirm what others say about Air Algérie. The planes are 90% of the time late the service is miserable and the planes are in a state where most airlines would take them out of service. Only small highlight is the consistent quality of the food which is not refined but good tasting. Air Algérie certainly is part of the Algeria experience but those who are scared of flying may not find this the most reassuring airline to go with. A word of advice as a business traveller - take business class there is a small lounge at the Airport in Algiers where you can at least pass your time when the flight is delayed.	0
GIG through EZE to USH. Initial check-in took 20 mins per person only 2 people working huge lines. Flight delayed more than 4 hours. No updates from the airline board still read on time. Missed connection in Buenos Aires no Business Class line rep tells me she can't help me reschedule my flight. No offer of meal tickets no lounge access they bump me to economy class and refuse to refund the difference - finally part with a voucher for a disgusting fast food place at the airport then the flight to Ushuaia is delayed 2 hours. Everything was a hassle. The lounge at Rio airport is a marathon to get to and a joke once you're there.	0
MEX-CDG-MEX. Food - awful both legs economy style (Chicken and pasta) and also overcooked. Only breakfast to CDG not so bad. Catering sequence nothing to do with Other Sky team airlines. Flight attendants do only what is necessary extras are difficult to get. Not recommended.	0
Travelled Premier Classe from Mexico City to Paris. This is an extremely poor business class product. On entering the plane we were offered a choice of water or orange juice; on asking for a glass of champagne was told very curtly by the steward that they had not chilled any so could not offer it! No personal IFE in seat only offer of ipad type product with limited selection. Meal very mediocre - choice of wines ok. Service from cabin crew very unfriendly and desultory - they seemed to have little interest in providing much service. Seat was acceptable. But this old 767 really needs an upgrade and the cabin crew need some serious customer service training. This business class product in no way compares with Air France or KLM their Skyteam and codeshare partners.	0
Astana-Sharjah-Astana. Aircraft new clean A320 with all economy cabin. There is no free food but you may choose some sandwiches and drinks for reasonable prices. Food is not good however. However wouldn't recommend to use this airline because of Sharjah airport. The terminal maintained very poorly and very dirty. People sleeping on the floor etc	0
Dep time 9:45pm Mumbai to Sharjah. We boarded the flight and after all the initial talks from the Captain etc were ready to take off. The captain must have noticed some sparks while taking off and he said that we are going to disembark. All the passengers were made to disembark and nothing else was told to us. We sat in the airport take off lounge waiting for an hour. finally after lots of noise made by the passengers a representative from Air Arabia arrived. She tried to convince the passengers but could not give a proper reply. At around 0030hrs the manager arrived and said that a spare part was coming from Sharjah in the morning flight 4:45am and that the flight was rescheduled to leave at 7am. No other compensation was offered to the customers. Some took the offer to cancel their flight while the rest who waited in the lounge were stranded without any offer from Air Arabia. Finally at around 3am after much heated discussion fried rice was offered to all. After that till 7:45am no staff from Air Arabia was present. When they came they again said that the flight was delayed no breakfast was offered. finally after much arguments we took off around 10.30am a long wait in the airport with no compensation! This experience must have made not only me but all the passenger that waited in that lounge dread flying with Air Arabia again. Everyone present there were hoping that Air Arabia would compensate us with something but nothing of that sort happened.	0
Sharjah to Muscat return. Flights departed and arrived on time. The flights have good leg space. Food is not served free.Ideal airline for business travellers who have to fly between the GCC countries.	0
I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.	0
This airline has no check-in agreements with other airlines if transiting with another airline allow time to clear immigration customs collect bags re-check-in etc because they cannot do it for you. Auckland to BA - toilet out of order. Return flight 7 weeks later same toilet out of order. Ceiling mounted TV was flickering for 13 hours. Service - rude. Movies - they only had 2. They lied to us about how long our flight would be delayed so they wouldn't have to pay for meals and accommodation. When we returned to the airport we found it was further delayed. We paid for 7 flights with AA and they changed departure and arrival times on us and in BA also switched arriving airports which meant we had to cross town to make our connecting flight. Don't order the special meals.	0
Mexico to Madrid and onward to Geneva via Air Europa. At check in they bungled up my frequent flyer number and kept telling me it was invalid. After the lousy check-in process I proceeded to the lounge at Mexico City airport terminal 2. The lounge has slow service with a poor selection of snacks and drinks. Lounge was crowded too. Inflight the seats in business were very small on this 767. The seats don't lie flat but at an angle. The best part no in-flight entertainment. The staff handed out ipads with a very limited selection of movies and TV shows. Food was awful and they did not have my option. Flight attendants could not be bothered with requests and soon disappeared after serving us our meals. Despite attempts to call them no one showed up. This is not business class but at best premium economy. Overall a very poor experience.	0
Sharjah to Muscat 2hrs delayed. Muscat to Sharjah 3.5hrs delayed. Bahrain to Sharjah 2.5 hrs delayed. Air Arabia has very bad on timings performance therefore if you go for business trip you should not fly with this airline.	0
Istanbul to Kathmandu and Jaipur to Istanbul I found the service provided by Air Arabia to be efficient prompt and reliable. No delays a fair service onboard (with a good selection of snacks at a reasonable price) as well as a quick transfer and 96 hour visa desk. The only problem is that in the evening (around 9-10pm the airport in Sharjah is crowded with many departures and arrivals. The immigration / security check sections are understaffed for this situation and there can be long queues. Hopefully the airport service will improve. Otherwise a fair mark for Air Arabia both for the service quality and for the good coverage of the Middle East  Central Asia.	0
It's a boon for business travellers who travel regularly within GCC. Excellent flight timings friendly staff on-time departures / arrivals and quality food on board at nominal price makes it ideal in terms of value for money. However the best feature I like of Air Arabia is the convenience of booking on-line from their fantastic web portal.	0
Recently flew from Sharjah to Aqaba to Sharjah for a family weekend in Petra Jordan. Schedule convenient flights on time clean and comfortable aircraft and very friendly cabin crew. On board food can be purchased with a good selection of quality sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Seats have a very good pitch and aircraft on both flights were very new. This airline is expanding in the middle east and I would recommend using them anytime as they are extremely good value for money. Also Sharjah airport much less congested than nearby Dubai. The whole experience resulted in a great holiday.	0
NAG-SHJ. A320 on this sector having television screens for every 3 rows. Earphones cost Dh 10 on board but I advise you to bring your walkman earphones and plug them in. The aisle is at least 7 inches wider than a normal A320 and if one person attempts to stow his baggage in the overhead locker the person behind him can move ahead without any discomfort and there are no bottlenecks. Seat pitch is good and even a 6ft 2ins person can stretch out comfortably.	0
2 hour delay leaving Sao Paulo a further 3 hour delay in the transit lounge at Buenos Aires. No information about this delay. No announcements no staff to get information. The screen simply said 'Delayed'. After 2 hours a garbled message in Spanish was given to take boarding passes to a cafe and get something to eat. I pre-booked vegetarian meals months ahead and confirmed at check-in 3 hours prior to departure. But my name was not on list. The plane was old with poor TV and disappearing staff. This airline runs a good domestic service. Messages in English to a predominantly English speaking transit lounge would be a basic and obvious service.	0
We flew Sep 23 New York - Dublin - Rome return Milan - Dublin - New York. New York - Dublin no problems food and entertainment poor. Embarking Dublin to Rome we were treated like small children (we are senior citizens) and were not permitted to take our carry on onto the plane. Terrible manners and we were embarrassed in front of the rest of the passengers. The return flight was uneventful but overall service very poor for an international airline.	0
I flew Aeroflot from AMS to PEK. The flight was cheaper than other flights but it was not worth the money saved. The seats have less leg room than other airlines I fly around 10 times a year and this was these were the smallest mos uncomfortable seat I have ever sat in and I am only 5'4 / 163 cm. Staff do not speak English but they were professional. The food was atrocious and the beverages were fine but I would like to see anyone screw up an apple juice. The inflight entertainment is almost non-existent playing old Tom and Jerry reruns on shared TV's in the aisles. I would not recommend Aeroflot.	0
Moscow - Hong Kong A330-300. Both flights delayed (40 minutes and almost 2 hours respectively) which might have been a problem if I had transit. The seats are atrocious and some of them were broken. Mine were broken on both flights (headrest wouldn't stay and the tray table was squeaky and uneven). The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem. The meal was mediocre quality hit or miss catering from Hong Kong significantly better than from Moscow. They ran out of meal options on both flights pretty quickly. IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats. I must say Aeroflot is quite good on short- haul and medium-haul European flights but I would never take a long-haul with them again - the seats the delays and overall service leaves a lot to be desired and the overall feel is Aeroflot doesn't care about its customers at all.	0
"Have flown from Doha to Sharjah quite a few times now and although Air Arabia is an excellent no-frills airline I must comment on the unreliability of the flight times from Doha on 2 occasions I have had to wait more than 5 hours for my 45 minute flight and have had little help from the ground staff. The last time I flew from Doha on the 13th October and the flight was supposed to be 12.50we took off at 6.35.After repeatedly asking ground staff what was the hold up I was told it was ""technical"" and that it would be sorted in 15 minutes. This went on for more than 5 hours with a whole plane load of passengers wandering around the airport very confused. There is very little trouble at the Sharjah end for departures and arrivals and I just hope that something can be done at the Doha end to avoid any more lengthy delays."	0
For a low cost carrier Air Arabia is an excellent choice to fly within the Middle East and beyond. Fast efficient check-in in Sharjah you can show up at the Check-In counter 45 min. before departure which is impossible in Dubai. Short ways in Sharjah Airport quite hassle free. New spotless clean planes very much on time. I flew Air Arabia 4 times so far to Kuwait two times Beirut and Colombo. Very reasonable prices for snacks and drinks only AED 10 for a large sandwich and AED 4 for a soft drink (US$ 2.50 and 1.00 approx). Very fast internet reservation website quick and user friendly.	0
Following my flight from SHJ-Beirut I flew back yesterday from Damascus. The inflight service was just as good though the aircraft was older. However the check-in in Damascus was terrible with all the line for the three desks merging into one big mass of people pushing to get served. I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know. Back in Sharjah the immigration area is confusingly laid out and getting a queue that moves is pot luck. here again everyone is pushing to get served. A nightmare on the ground but great in the air.	0
I've tried flying with Air-Arabia and the fare is cheap. but the problem lies in the passengers well in such an low cost flight one may encounter those passengers that shower only once a week and whose habits are a bit rude or nasty.	0
MAD-EZE-MAD. The airplane is an old 747 that it seems to be torn to pieces. You have great room for your legs while seated in those old cradles. There are rather comfortable though. Inflight entertainment does not work in 50% of the seats and flight attendants will never give you a proper solution. Food is ok but there's not much to choose but wines are superb.	0
"AEP-USH. The departure time and flight number were different on the e-ticket boarding card and departure screen. Nobody could provide an explanation but in the end that didn't matter as it was 4-5 hours late depending on which time you chose. The aircraft was an elderly MD88 with no APU working hence the interior was stifling when we boarded. Leg room was appalling. The ""snack"" was inedible and the coffee undrinkable. To cap it all one bag was lost for 4 days."	0
JFK-CUN-JFK. Why bother asking me online what seat I want when I cant even get it when I book months in advance? Once onboard it was quite stuffy and hot. Surprisingly they did serve a meal. The return was ok but the cabin crew were pretty rude and unfriendly. I wouldn't recommend Aeromexico unless you looking for a cheap flight and have no expectation.	0
SAT-MEX-OAX. From San Antonio to Mexico City flight was good. From Mexico City to Oaxaca we got on board on time then had to wait almost an hour and a half for 3 more passengers. 3 people making 100+ people wait. Flight back from OAX-MEX-SAT Oaxaca to Mexico was fine. From Mexico City to San Antonio we arrive at our gate at 7.13 flight was scheduled to leave at 7.10. Aeromexico representative made no effort to try and communicate our situation to the flight crew made no effort to try and help us reschedule a flight simply turned away. Had to go talk to another rep who let us know that since we booked our flight online she couldn't sell us another ticket until I got in touch with the online site and figured out their procedure. I have no phone in Mexico and no Internet which made this extremely difficult. Never flying Aeromexico again.	0
Trip was Aberdeen to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Flight was over booked. So we got bumped off the flight the issue with Aer Lingus is that they really could not be bothered to sort the problem out. We ended up paying for a cab to Edinburgh but why could Aer Lingus not have managed to do that.	0
"Travelled from Dublin to Nice in July. I was seated in front of the emergency rows. When the doors closed I asked a flight attendant if I could take a seat in one of the empty emergency seats. There were 3 consecutive seats empty. You would think that I had just stolen the crown jewels! The young flight attendant berated me with sarcasm ""you have to pay for them"" in her loudest Dublin accent. This is not the first time I've experienced this type of condescending attitude from an Aer Lingus flight attendant. Totally unnecessary. Unfortunately no other airline flys Dublin/Nice."	0
Damascus to Sharjah with Air Arabia on march 27. Air Arabia is a low-cost airline - never had such legroom at other airlines in economy class. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I can recommend this airline for travelling in the Middle East.	0
Sydney to Buenos Aires with AL return a disappointing experience. Both flights left an hour late without explanation. When we booked flights in Australia we chose our seats and our choice apparently accepted. We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion. We flew a number of internal flights with LAN which is worlds ahead of AL on service.	0
I am not looking forward to my return flight from Australia to NZ. Delayed 6 hours with no explanation dirty trays chewing gum on the arm rests. The flight crew sat in the departure gate and took up two rows of seats while we all stood. An overhead TV that didn't work and a loud speaker that was so loud we had our fingers in our ears. Nothing impressive here.	0
Airport staff refused to relay flight information in English to all English speaking customers. Mexico City airport is poorly labelled and difficult to find your way around. When we asked staff for help or directions we were given different directions each time. Since we has a 12 delay due to yet another flight cancellation we tested this hypothesis on a 7 staff members. When we originally selected our flights to Costa Rica this airline offered the best route. Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.	0
Our flight was from Cancun to Mexico City then to LAX. The airport terminal was extremely warm and the flight left late. Not sure what the problem was but it was very hot on both flights. Since our flight left Cancun late we had to run from one gate to the other in order to not miss our connecting flight. So of course since we barely made our flight our bags didn't we were told our luggage would be delivered the next morning - well it is almost 8 pm and still no luggage. Not sure I would ever fly Aeromexico again.	0
I flew on a flight from Cork to Paris yesterday and to my horror I was scolded by ground staff that my baggage was overweight. I was shocked because I bought a more expensive ticket that allowed me to carry 2 bags. However in the fine print of Aer Lingus it states that whether you carry one or two bags the maximum weight allowable is 20kg. This makes absolutely no sense in having 2 bags of 10kg since the bag itself weights about 2kg to 3 kg so you lose out if you carry 2 bags. Your total weight allowance shrinks from 20kg to 17kg if you carry one bag and if you carry two bags it shrinks from 20kg to 14kg as the 2 bags will weigh 6kg in total. So I paid extra money for absolutely nothing. I thought that when you paid extra money you will be allowed to carry 2 bags of 20kg each (totalling to 40kg). This is the worse thing I found about Aer Lingus. I had to pay EUR75 for 5 kg overweight. Also this flight had no business class and I had taken the highest class available called Economy Class Flexi Fare. Even my Star Alliance Gold Card was not useful.	0
From CDG to BKK via SVO 26/27 Dec 2012. Firstly the plane from Moscow to Paris arrived late causing us to have a delay our original transfer time between Terminals at Moscow was due to be 1hr 55mins but with this delay it was about 30 minutes now. Eventually boarded and was a nice trip. Arrived Moscow through Passport Control and Security then a long fast walk to Terminal F told to go to gate 46 arrived there no passengers around then told to go to another gate arrived there to find the flight was delayed for technical reasons original boarding was at 20.00hrs but told to come back to the gate at 21.05hrs. At the new time were let through to go onto the Air Bridge instead of an aircraft at the end of the bridge was a metal staircase and buses got on the bus doors wide open minus 20 outside. Eventually doors closed bussed to far end of airport and held in the bus 50metres from the aircraft a wait of 20 minutes and we were let onto the plane after our brisk 50m walk. Passengers boarded then 2.5 hrs after original take off time we eventually got into position. Flight okay food edible. Upon arrival at BKK just after landing and heading towards the Air Bridge passengers rushing to get to the door the plane had not even left the taxiing area. For me a never again adventure with Aeroflot.	0
I have flown with Aerolineas about 6 times over the last 4/5 years. Every single flight was either cancelled or delayed. The staff are generally not that bad and they take a lot of stick from people. Food no real issues. The flights themselves are just so unreliable.	0
"I took two intercontinental flights (MAD-EZE and back) and six internal flights with Aerolineas. All eight flights were more or less on time the planes were clean and baggage always arrived without delay but service on all flights was poor and food all but inedible. There is a difference between the internal and the intercontinental flights however: the cabin crews on internal flights were just indifferent and bored on the intercontinental flights they were rude and in some instances overtly hostile. Ground staff generally falls into the category ""indifferent"" with a few positive exceptions. Conclusion: Try avoiding Aerolineas for intercontinental flights but for internal flights it's ok."	0
Business from TIJ-CUN with family. After the flight was delayed for 2 hrs in TIJ with no explanation the ground crew had the audacity to ask me why we were late to catch the CUN flight. Seats were very uncomfortable for Biz class no leg room and the pitch hardly had any angle. My neck was hurting after couple of hrs. Food awful. FA's couldn't care less attitude made this 6 hrs trip unbearable.	0
This was my first time flying Aer Lingus. Flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland then back from Dublin Ireland to Chicago. The trip there was fabulous! Great customer service great food! The trip home on the other hand was disappointing. I have never experienced such rude customer service. The food was also extremely spicy when I asked if I could buy some snacks since I was starving I was informed that they cannot sell me any. Won't be flying Aer Lingus again.	0
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Cabin crew extremely rude simple requests such as glasses of water plainly ignored. Food was sub standard and if you felt peckish after the meal you were abruptly told to go help yourself at the rear of the plane to a platter of soggy cheese and butter sandwiches. Same for drinks pour- your-own-glass at the back of the pane in full view of the cabin crew who just pretended you didn't exist. Overall cabin crew appeared quite blasé and pompous.	0
IGR to AEP. Flight was showing delayed on the airport website still on time on the AR website. Unable to process web check-in. Complete chaos at the airport since the previous flight had been cancelled and the flight after ours was also cancelled. Not a single AR check-in staff or management available. After one hour of waiting with no announcement in English or Spanish or any AR check-in staff in sight we decided to take an 18 hours bus ride to ensure we get to BEU on time for our flight back to Canada the next day.	0
AEP to SLA. Initially scheduled for departure at 18.05. Delayed various times until finally dropped from the monitor after midnight. Flight was cancelled no announcements in English very few announcements in Spanish. Misleading information about new flight the next morning initial departure at 06.30 from AEP then at 09.30 from EZE final departure ex AEP at 09.30. Only compensation for the 16 hours delay a dry piece of pizza and a can of Sprite. Flight was an old B737-500 despite the rebooking we were on standby for this flight and got the last seats on the aircraft.	0
Booked a direct flight from Miami to Cancun 6 months in advance. Shocked to learn a week before the trip that the flight was changed to have a layover in Mexico city. Now the flight turned into a 8 hour trip. Despite never advising of the change Aeromexico had the audacity to try to charge a $150 cancellation fee. On the connecting plane I spoke to other passengers who gave similar or even worse stories. Some said the website still showed a direct flight from their destinations even though it had changed.	0
Aug 22nd 2013 Flight EI0105 DUB to JFK. I have to say that I am a frequent flyer with Aer Lingus over the years and I have seen a steady deterioration in the customer service of the airline attendants. I feel that re-education in customer service would benefit many employees of Aer Lingus. Quite frankly food was almost thrown at us when served no smiles and no manners! My friend is a gold circle member and did not accept the dinner served he asked for cheese and crackers and was told there was none.	0
Flew Dublin - Amsterdam. Despite having bought the ticket with KLM's Flying Blue programme number I was forced to pay extra fee for my luggage. Staff very unfriendly even when I asked for such a standard thing like having my own personal copy of inflight magazine. My luggage got lost. Interior of airplanes shabby.	0
CAI-ATH-CAI. Flight was on time ground handling efficient. The flight was operated by the small ARJ Aircraft the Crew was inefficient and rude. Meals were below average.	0
Flew to Mauritius and my experience was unsatisfactory. The service was appalling. I pressed the hostess button numerous times with no response. One meal throughout the journey was inadequate with a very small snack before landing. My snack was a soggy sandwich and breakfast was no better. I will not recommend this airline. Quality is of the essence.	0
Auckland-Buenos Aires. Pleased about the leg room however their flights late or just cancelled for no reason. The food was ok hostesses were direct with them wanting to give you hot drinks cold drinks or snacks. Check-in took 1 hr 40 mins so be prepared.	0
Mexico City to Merida Dec 25. Was not allowed to choose a seat when purchasing a ticket not during online check-in either and at the airport I was told the plane and seats were full. I was stuck by the window with the wall sloping inward - I am a large wide-shouldered man. Flights were torturous as was waiting on the tarmac for 30-40 minutes with no explanation as to why. No food or entertainment available.	0
Took a short haul from Glasgow to Dublin and a long-haul from Dublin to Boston. Flights were on time and boarding was well-organized. The seats were comfortable but everything looked tired and not exactly pristine. IFE is nearly impossible to use as the touch-screens wouldn't respond to pressure. The meal was okay (biryani chicken) though the piece of meat was about as big as an eraser. The flight attendants (save for one very nice girl) were sulky and bored and made us all feel like we were cattle. As we left the plane the cabin attendant didn't even look up into our faces when she said goodbye. In a nutshell the price was good but the service was shocking given the generally warm nature of all the Irish folk I know. Most peculiar.	0
Boarded Aeroflot in Amsterdam for flight to Moscow. Just prior to departing the gate there was a loud commotion in the rear of the plane - it seems we were traveling with a restrained reluctant prisoner. We checked in for our return flight in St. Petersburg for Amsterdam. We requested that we and our luggage be booked thru to Detroit. the attendant assured us that it was done. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were informed by KLM that they did not receive confirmation of our flight from Amsterdam to Detroit and our seats had been resold. 10 hours later we were aboard a Delta flight on the way home. The issue was not in translation because our request had been relayed by our Russian Tour director and our luggage was booked thru to Detroit. Never again.	0
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Not impressed staff sometimes quite rude. One meal with drinks provided after take off soggy sandwich about half way and small snack before landing. Drinks few and far between we could go and help ourselves to warm drinks with no ice. Overall would not fly Air Austral again and would not recommend it. Return flight not better!	0
Three days of delay (Buenos Aires-Madrid). The aircraft is in poor condition and the airline personnel are not helpful. They won't even give passengers an explanation for the delay and told us to file our complaints online.	0
Mexico City to Narita thru Tijuana. At check-in I requested for check-thru for my baggage but the man in the counter said it is not possible. I got alarmed when my other colleagues (we were in a group reservation) baggage were checked-thru. I had to recall from baggage and made to baggage drop for check-thru to Manila via Narita. Mexico City to Tijuana leg we were assigned a seat number - 14E which did not exist. So they found us seats on row 22. When we reached Tijuana we stayed on board and we asked if we needed to change seats as we were given boarding pass with different seat assignments. Again I was assigned seat 12A which still does not exist in the plane. We were made to sit in other seats and we had to bring our blankets and earphones because they do not issue fresh ones. We had connecting flights in Narita for our trip to Manila. When we got to Manila our baggage did not come with us. For 2 days we tracked our delayed baggage and learned they were not loaded apparently when we left Mexico.	0
Flew to Dublin from Heathrow outbound flight was delayed by an hour return journey the next day was delayed because the first officer was late he arrived they then decided he'd flown too many hours in the day and left. A 7.20pm arrival became a 8.45pm arrival.	0
Madrid to Beijing via Moscow. I paid 457 euro with taxes included which was a great price. The plane going over was shabby looking inside with no IFE. The food was just ok and the cabin crew never even smiled once or were standing at the door with leaving the plane. I say over all they need to improve on customer service and update the planes a little.	0
"Budapest-Moscow-Beijing and Shanghai-Moscow-Budapest. All flights were delayed about 2 hours without explanation. Staff in Budapest and Moscow - very rude they don't speak English and whenever you ask something the answer is ""we don't know""."	0
Flew Air Austral return Sydney to Mauritius. Male flight attendants on the flight to RUN - nice however food provided is limited and alcohol only during meal times. Water is in short supply and passengers at the back of the plane were forgotten about almost all the time and rationing of water became an issue towards the end of the journey. Passengers were made to stay overnight in RUN - hotel stay provided to some passengers were terrible no assistance from the airline or hotel and dinner not provided (incur at passenger's expense). Return flight home was canceled with no word to most passengers (only upon check-in). Flight was canceled due to poor maintenance of the plane which suffered system difficulties on it's previous long haul journey and was forced to attempt emergency landing 3 times - and we were going to take this plane home! Was put up again at the same terrible hotel for the night. Female flight attendants extremely rude impatient and unwilling to communicate to passengers who cannot speak fluently in French. Very disappointed in the service provided by Air Austral will not fly again.	0
Montevideo to Buenos Aires. Delay of about 2 hours for a flight that lasted 45 mins. saw the plane. No crew member or agent to ask for information. On board the crew were not attentive and paid little attention to passengers.	0
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia return. I flew from Ushuaia back to Buenos Aires and it was absolute chaos. The previous 2 days flights had been cancelled due to Chile Volcano the airport was full of people and there was no organisation or communication for waiting passengers. There were lots of angry passengers a TV crew and lots of police but a lack of Aerolineas staff.	0
New Zealand to Buenos Aires. They cancelled our flights and had wait hours in Argentina. The crew were not polite they did not provide accommodation and did not listen to our complaints. I needed to call to New Zealand to get someone from Aerolineas to answer my queries.	0
We were traveling to San Luis Potosi from Phoenix. Check in took 1.5 hours we got 5 seats two or 3 rows separated from each other (3 kids 47 and 10). We relied on the kindness of people on the plane to get all the seats together. For delays we lost the connection flight to SLP in Mexico City and we got a flight next day (18 hours later from our original). I asked for compensation for the hotel expenses We got nothing but the worst is that at the next day We just find out that local passengers got hotel expenses and we were international. I am going to use this airline.	0
A comedy of errors! Two days after the switchover to the SABRE reservation system check-in was still delayed a lot because they never trained their staff on the new system! My SAT-MEX flight left and arrived two hours late. There was no announcement of the cause for the delay. It took the agents about 10 minutes to check a passenger. As passengers finally trickled to the gate there was no agent and no sign confirming that this was an Aeromexico departure gate - and there was no plane. On the return May 29 things were still a bit slow that's when the agent told me that she had arrived at work on May 22 to find totally new screens on which she had received no training. The system also told them (on May 29) that I hadn't paid when in fact it was a prepaid Expedia ticket. Apparently they had changed the flight number right as they were switching systems and my reservation was not transferred correctly. After my flight boarded they announced that the co-pilot hadn't arrived! Hence a half-hour delay. Totally amateurish performance throughout by this airline which I will try to avoid flying.	0
Edinburgh to Dublin. A one hour flight. My luggage was left in Edinburgh. There was little in the way of service or concern and I was left with the impression that this happens on a regular basis.	0
"Four flights Boston to Dublin Dublin to Milan Milan to Dublin and Dublin to Boston. Short leg flights were okay. Just 2 hours although we didn't see much of the crew and surprised that the only refreshment available on board had to be purchased. Long haul legs were another story. Incredibly disorganized ""mob boarding"" in Boston. Flight crew on outbound leg were quite grumpy and unfriendly. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian special meal with an allergy requirement. They got the allergy but not the veg part and I was presented with a hunk of chicken which the flight attendant said she thought was ""Just a bit of tofu."" Offered cheese and crackers. Returning I had called to make sure I got a suitable dinner. Well they had one but I heard them give it to the woman behind me. I had to explain to her that she had my food and get it back. On the return flight a flight attendant came with a big bag of blankets tossed the bag into the corner ripped the bag open and said not one word to anyone. No hot drinks available in the first round of service. Dinner trays stayed around far too long. On the return leg the promised ""afternoon tea service"" was delayed and was basically thrown at us. After we landed there was no attention from the crew. I've been flying internationally for nearly 50 years and have taken a lot of airlines and never seen anything quite like this."	0
PVG-SVO-AMS. Got the lowest price available by a long way so wasn't expecting too much. The flight from PVG-SVO was at 1.40am - the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared TVs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. Staff were so serious that it was quite comical (does it hurt to smile?). SVO-AMS was again on a very basic plane this time with no TVs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor English. Acceptable for a very cheap flight but I wouldn't choose them if there were other airlines at a similar price.	0
Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR-72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The in-flight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.	0
Noumea to Sydney found Air Austral staff friendly and good customer service. My only issue was the size of the seats in economy - a tight fit.	0
Only flew Air Austral for medium haul (RUN-SEY) but was excellent! Good service much space good food and very friendly staff! Next time we might choose them also for long haul.	0
CDG-RUN-CDG: Checkin at CDG was fast and even faster at RUN. Very friendly staff at both airports and during flight. 777 are in good shape and the cabin clean and comfortable. Food was excellent - also a lot of choice for drinks including wine during dinner. Cabin crew present and often come along with water during the night. An amenity kit is distributed after takeoff with socks earphones earplugs and eyemask. Only drawback is that there are no PTV's and there's not much info from the cockpit. All in all a very good experience.	0
JNB-RUN-JNB. I have travelled with Air Austral 4 times between Johannesburg and Reunion. My first trip was in 1992 - my latest was in November 2005. Before my latest trip I was of the opinion that they were one of the best airline I had flown economy class. Their B737's were configured 100% economy. Now they have a 'Business Class' and economy seems to have deteriorated to 'Cattle Class' - and they are 'just another airline'. All of their service levels have dropped to mediocre. I still plan to use them again this year as I love the island and Air Austral are the only airline that flies from Johannesburg to Reunion.	0
Rude Staff old aircraft Lost our bags but didn't care why. We were left in New Zealand and passengers weren't advised of new flight time on different airline - the whole team disappeared from airport and left passengers wondering what to do. We had to pay $100 to get our bags to Sydney with Air NZ because they have a different baggage allowance. Little customer service skills.	0
Santiago-Buenos Aires-Rome and back. The planes are evidently old and the entertainment system is very mediocre especially for a 13+ hr trip. The food given was good enough and the crew was nice although they didn't offer anything unless you asked them. The biggest problem was the schedule on my return flights the plane from Rome to Buenos Aires was delayed 6 hrs we had to wait 6 more hrs in Buenos Aires to get back on a plane to Santiago (delayed an extra hour). They were good enough to move me and my sister to Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires because of the problems although this was possible only because my dad and uncle were in Business already. Business class didn't offer many improvements in comparison to other airlines the seats although more comfortable than the Economy ones weren't as good as other airlines and the entertainment system was almost the same as in Economy.	0
I have travelled many times with this airline and have not had any problems. However I am disgusted with the way that the airline has handled the problem with the Volcano in Chile. I understand that flights need to be cancelled but Aerolineas is not communicating with its passengers and is also not making any attempts to help those trapped in Argentina due to flight cancellations. The staff were very rude even getting up and walking away. It is such a disappointment to see the way that passengers are being treated. Those of us trying to reschedule our flights are having problems getting through to the call centre. Very unprofessional.	0
LHR-CDG-MEX-MZT. Last leg AeroMexico MEX-MZT ground staff in MEX unhelpful checked in as soon as possible and still couldn't get us seats together (only two of us) for any of our connections. Trying to submit comments to their customer service afterwards gets you no where except repeated automated messages and there is no customer service number you can reach from the UK. I would never fly them again if there was an alternative.	0
When I called the customer service representative to voice my displeasure with my flight the representative was rude while speaking and even hung up on me. He offered no help and even attempted to mock me. As beautiful as Cancun was I would never go back if my only option was to fly AeroMexico. Cheap flights means cheap service and even worse customer assistance.	0
SJO-SAT. Supposed to leave SJO and be home by 3:30pm on Saturday. Did not arrive home until Monday at 3.30 pm. This airline was a joke. The first day they had us wait in the airport for 12 hours only to tell us we wouldn't be able to leave. The next day our flight was delayed due to a flight attendant not having correct documentation to leave the country. Due to the delay half the flight missed their connections in Mexico City causing another overnight stay. We were never offered a refund for the flight or any inconvenience it caused.	0
Had a disappointing start to our holiday! Delayed 2 hours from Manchester to Dublin no one kept us updated and when we got on the aircraft it was filthy! Never flown with Aer Lingus before and don't plan on flying with them again!	0
Yangon to Lashio in November 2009 ATR 42 plane. Allocated seating and good snack served with excellent customer service. Would fly with them again any time!	0
I haven't had such a good quality of service or food on a tourist-class ticket in over 15 years (or more!). Our choice of Air Austral the first time was based mainly on the basis of our connection possibilities from Denmark. Next time it will be as a choice made by satisfied and loyal customers that believe that good treatment should be rewarded.	0
I recently flew to Reunion on Air Austral and was very impressed. I found the service was excellent and far superior to that of Air France.	0
I currently live in London and I fly once a year to Reunion for holidays. I use to fly on Air France in classe Alize (Economy Plus) but recently I tried Air Austral for the first time in Classe Loisirs (Economy) and was far more satisfied with the level of customer care in terms of punctuality high food quality and friendly staff. As being part of the Air France Frequence Plus scheme the good news is I can get some qualifying miles and this code-share flight makes my life easy as I don't need to change airport - ie remaining in CDG and not going to Orly. So I would recommend Air Austral in terms of: Comfort: their B777 is modern the seats are more comfortable and you have more space to put your hand luggage in the compartments above your head. Food: even in Classe Loisirs you have a huge plateau and you are really spoilt. Customer care: excellent staff. They provide you with warm towels as you get on board and in the morning. They also pass through at night asking you if you want some water while everyone is asleep. Everything with a smile! Punctuality: both outbound and return flights left on time. Unfortunately I read that Air France will stop this code-share flight with Air Austral and I find this decision very sad. I wish everyone who is part of Frequence Plus loyalty scheme to convince Air France to come back to its decision as the CDG-RUN-CDG must not disappear. Air Austral is the getaway to Reunion via CDG for all European and worldwide customers and you won't be disappointed. Thanks to Air Austral we are getting better airline service to Reunion excellent staff quality and well-deserved comfort. I'm very happy about their level of professionalism and the image the airline portrays of Reunion Island.	0
I flew this with this airline around the Indian Ocean with this airline for business purposes. There punctuality is great they are more often before time rather than on time. Recently i got the opportunity to try there new RUN-CDG-RUN flight in club class. Here also am very satisfied. There REPS in Mauritius are very competent. I recommend you this airline.	0
I'm used to fly with the french national airline because I'm a top-tier Frequence Plus cardholder but I have decided to try Air Austral on a trip from Reunion Island to Paris return in Business Class (they call it Club Austral). I have not been disappointed. The onboard crew was extremely helpful and smiley from boarding to disembarking. The seat which can recline 140 degrees -almost flat bed - is very comfortable good width and pitch. The food is tasty and includes a creole dish accompanied with spicy condiments and an interesting variety of wines. Even the bread is warm unlike other airlines I'm used to travel with. I have been especially impressed by the quality of the service on board and this from the FA to the captain. Good work.	0
This is by far the worst airline. Rude staff most dilapidated aircraft and 13 hours late - need I go on. Cheap rates but not cheap enough.	0
Had difficulty finding anyone that spoke understandable English. Luggage didn't make a flight in Mexico City then was delivered to hotel in Cancun. All luggage from group of 10 traveling the same route had been completely ransacked with items stolen. On return trip Aeromexico customer service was a joke and did not tell me I should check an item in Cancun that was too large to fit in luggage. Flight attendant helped place it during the first flight. It was then confiscated in Mexico City due to different security standards there. Mexico City airport was also a nightmare.	0
SFO-MEX direct flight departed on time. Business class seat were very uncomfortable. A red eye flight but cant sleep due to the seat type.	0
Mexico-Lima flight was really bad and service terribles. They serve you just a meal and after the crew disappear - no movies and music program was not working well. Boeing 737-800 and for six hour flight is a narrow plane.	0
Flight was switch around twice. First was delay the flight 7 hrs then the early fight I had at 7am was pushed back 3hrs with no phone call. Communication is important and so is time. The flight you book is tentative so don't be surprised if you book a flight and end up with a flight at a different time.	0
"No real complaints about the flight or in service facilities. Main complaint is about the badly designed website. I was flying Shannon to Boston and then on to Tampa with JetBlue. AL kept emailing me to complete the ""Additional Information Required"". However their website kept rejecting my booking reference. Tried to email them (no reply). Tried over 3 days to telephone AL kept getting recorded messages. Spent at least 1 hour trying to get through to a ""person"". Eventually did to be told my booking reference was rejected as I was flying on to another destination (Tampa). Then she took the additional info and did it for me. Seems this is a routine problem! AL also could not print off Jetblue boarding card Jetblue referred me back to AL."	0
8 July flew SVO-DEL in economy class. Unfortunately A330 was unavailable for this trip (despite being advertised on the website) and instead we boarded a Soviet era IL96's. Flight left at least an hour late many of the seats failed to recline and there was no onboard entertainment system in economy. No apologies were offered for this bait-and-switch move by the airline. A glance at the business class section revealed two rows of slightly oversize seats separated by a curtain across the entire width of the cabin. If I were a business class passenger I would be furious . Other than that the flight was relatively smooth and uneventful. My advice would be to avoid this airline on flights over 3 hours and go with the competition instead.	0
MDL-SND-RGN on ATR . Flights were always in time the planes are modern staff is very pleasant and we felt very safe on board. Check in without problems free seating and even for bigger people sufficient legroom . Would fly again with Air Bagan	0
RGN-SNW-RGN. Modern ATR 42 aircraft good safety briefing very quick turnaround with seat allocation on way out (70% full) and free seating on return. Aircraft departure on time and luggage off quickly each time. Snack soft drink and tea/coffee on short 45 minute flight. Great views from 16000ft over Irrawaddy plain and Arakan hills and exciting approach over the sea and surf to short landing strip between the palm trees. Good experience.	0
RGN-HEH and NYU-MDL-HEH-RGN. All flights on time clean planes even the older Fokker 100 a nice in flight snack and very friendly flight attendants. Since I was traveling in the off season most of the passengers were actually local with a few package tourists on the return leg. Boarding passes handwritten you must also show your passport for domestic flights in Myanmar.	0
Yangon to Heho via Nyaung U in February with Air Bagan very pleasant. Inflight experience good with clean cabins and nice and attentive crew. They served even on this short flight a little breakfast with cold-cuts and cold omelette which was ok. As the previous comment states the problem is rather the infrastructure on the ground. Everything is still very old fashioned with hand written tickets and passenger lists and baggage handled by hand or on trolleys pushed by man as well and power shortage even in public airport areas. Booked through local travel agent who kept us informed of flight changes so saved us the hassle to deal with airline ticket sales directly. As we were on a holiday it was a bizarre but entertaining experience and it felt like what airtravel must have been like 50 years ago.	0
Yangon-Thandwe(Ngapali)-Yangon. The flights were operated by ATR-42. Seating is not comfortable unless you take an emergency-exit row but on 40-50 minute flight you don't need comfortable seats. Inflight service great. Wet paper towels given to each passenger on the entrance to the plane. The food service was rather interesting - they gave us a chicken sandwich (really tasty) then they brought around some coffee and tea and about 10 minutes later-Cola and Sprite on a tray. Crew were very friendly and polite. Yangon Airport in its domestic part is really not modern with some not- functioning facilities and broken toilets. Thandwe airport is an experience itself! Overall Air Bagan offers excellent reliable service and I will fly it again when visiting a wonderful country Myanmar!	0
We spent 4 weeks in Argentina and took 5 flights with is airline. In this time they lost my baggage for two days cancelled one flight with no previous notice delayed two times and worst of all the last airplane we took tried to depart and stop last minute twice due to technical difficulties. We had to wait for 24 hrs for them to fix it and lost our connections to Mexico. The company refused to assist us to solve any problem and kept saying : there's nothing we can do present your claim on line. I will never flight with Aerolíneas Argentinas again!	0
Flew Aeromexico five times during a recent trip to Cuba and Mexico. All five flights had significant delays with complete abdication of responsibility by airline staff who lied to and misled passengers. flight from Havana to Mexico City was delayed by 24 hrs with the ground staff in Havana clueless on the reason for the delay for the first four hours. Shabby treatment of all passengers the next day with no water or food. Flight back to Mexico City was 2hr s45min - and we were served peanuts. Crew unfriendly do not like to smile.	0
CDG-MEX-PVR and PVR-MEX. I was disappointed by the service from Cabin crew. On previous trips crew were friendly and talked to passenger. CDG-PVR leg operated by a reconfigured 767 with expanded Business class cabin. Flew economy - seat was ok but with no foot-rest. MEX-PVR-MEX operated by EM-145's they only had one cabin attendant. I had no real issue apart from the fact the crew were not that friendly.	0
London to Moscow then Moscow to Shanghai. Experienced a poor service throughout except for the food. At check-in I asked if I could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom (I'm 6ft 7ins) I was told I had to pay 50 pounds if I wanted it. Of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights I was sat in between passengers. Both aircraft's were very old especially for the long haul Moscow to Shanghai. Entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin - the worst entertainment I've ever endured on a 9 hour flight. Staff seemed slow and unresponsive at times however did serve regular drinks and the food was nice. In future I would rather pay a bit extra with other airlines. Overall a poor service.	0
Air Bagan may be Myanmar’s fastest growing airline even having international ambitions but we had the experience they are not really that well organized internally. We booked a number of domestic flights with them and tickets were written out with OK status on February the 12th when we picked them up in their downtown Yangon office. A week later when we checked in at Nyaung U for a NYE-HEH flight Air Bagan staff told us flight AKY-RGN we booked was cancelled and we had to contact Air Bagan in Taunggyi once we arrived in HEH to arrange alternative travel. After arrival in HEH we contacted Air Bagan in Taunggyi who told us no flights were cancelled. We asked them to verify this again and later that night Air Bagan called us we didn’t have to worry and the AKY-RGN flight would certainly fly. A few days later we flew HEH-SNW and as we had a reservation to fly SNW-AKY the next day we once more checked with Air Bagan at SNW airport on the AKY-RGN flight. We now were told AKY-RGN was cancelled as AKY airport would be closed ‘for maintenance’ for several days! The SNW-AKY we booked would still operate but as return flights for the next days would not operate we of course decided to cancel SNW-AKY. Air Bagan didn’t seem to understand why we didn’t want to fly SNW-AKY. Having no return flight from AKY didn’t seem to be an issue for them and they suggested us to buy a full fare SNW-RGN flight. They agreed to refund us the cancelled flights (after paying a cancellation fee) but refund could only be made in the Air Bagan office where we paid the tickets! This would mean we had to go back to downtown Yangon what we hadn’t planned into our travel schedule anymore. After several discussions with Air Bagan staff in SNW and with the help of our hotel manager in Ngapali the next day when we showed up at SNW airport for the SNW-RGN flight local Air Bagan staff appeared to be very helpful and tickets were paid back at SNW airport and fare for the SNW-RGN was ‘Town Office’ and not ‘Published’ full fare. We were very pleased local Air Bagan staff in SNW understood the issue and willing as well to refund us but next time I book a flight with them I’ll think twice.	0
Flight suspended in Aukland for 24hrs due to an industrial dispute (they told us it was due to an engineering issue but we found out later this was a lie). Although we were put up in a hotel room it still lost us one day out of 10 of our hard saved visit to relatives. Waited in Auckland airport for 8 hrs before they ferried us out to hotel - dinner at 3am and had to be awake by 8 to go again (we had kids with us). Flight home was delayed again at Argentina (captain turned up 2 hours late).	0
Came To Argentina for vacations. The first flight (Bogota to Buenos Aires) suffered a 12 hour delay four internal flights in Argentine were all delayed (hours of delay) and the last one (Iguazu to Buenos Aires) was cancelled! They took us to a filthy hotel in Iguazu. With these problems it is not worth to talk about service or food.	0
I've flown from Auckland to Sao Paulo and return twice with this airline over the last four years - best thing is the price. Food acceptable - I'm not fussy about food. Staff inclined to be offhand and more interested in socialising among themselves. Announcements very thickly accented English - difficult to comprehend at times. Cabin interior - on my first trip the reading light came away in my hand and the projected movie seemed to have been soaked in bleach before screening. On the second trip there was no film at all with no explanation or apology from the crew. Lateness - first trip OK. Second trip a shocker. Six-hour delay in leaving due to unspecified technical difficulties. On late arrival in Buenos Aires confusion reigned with passengers asking each other what was going on as most connections had been missed. By a mysterious process (no thanks to the airline's staff) I found myself on a coach with other mystified passengers thinking we were heading to a hotel for the night (it was very late). Instead we were taken to another airport and hastily put aboard another plane. I got to Brazil but landed in the wee small hours and faced an uncomfortable night sleeping on the floor of the terminal. Aerolineas thereby escaped having to foot the bill for hotel rooms.	0
LAX to PVR. It's unethical to say the least. AeroMexico had a good selection of non-stop flights from LAX to PVR. Seats were more expensive than connecting flights on the U.S. based airlines. We were willing to pay extra for the non-stop flight. A week before our departure AeroMexico moved us to an indirect flight connecting through Mexico City. Our only other option was accepting a voucher from AeroMexico and rebooking on another airline at our own expense. Due to the short notice all flights (even connecting) were two to three times more expensive than they were when we had originally purchased the tickets. The annoyance doesn't end there. In Mexico City we only had one hour to change planes. Normally this would be easy. We didn't know we had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people already in line. Needless to say we missed our connection. We waited all day in the airport for another flight that had seats available.	0
We recently traveled from the US to Ireland. When we called in on seat assignments for the flight over we paid an extra $60 per person for seats that were to have more room (Rows 9-12) so we could sleep better. Turns out that the seats we had on the way home had more leg room and reclined further so that was wasted money. On the way home the entertainment recycled twice so there was a while where you couldn't watch a movie and since we were in the middle of one when it went down had to adjust it to get back to the spot where it crashed.	0
"Economy from Glasgow via Dublin to New York return. Glasgow to Dublin flight arrived on time and all US bound passengers were met at the arriving flight and bussed to the international terminal. For this flight we had US Pre-clearance at Dublin Airport. However waiting time was horrendous. Flight was due to depart at 10.15 and at 10.45 we still hadn't completed this procedure. Aer Lingus held the onward flight for all connecting passengers resulting in a one hour delay leaving Dublin. Airbus 330-300 seating was comfortable enough for the 6 hr flight. The on demand video system offered ample films. The headphones however of poor quality and sound. A pre-dinner drink was served. Soft drinks are free alcoholic drinks have to be paid for. Meal was mediocre and tasteless. The crew did not come around offering drinks. The younger cabin attendants were friendly. Older crew members acted like their job was a chore. Many not able to smile. Because we had pre-cleared US Immigration at Dublin we were therefore classified as a ""domestic flight"" and landed at Jet Blue's Terminal 5 in JFK. Because of this and the somewhat lower fare these points would be the only reason I would choose to fly Aer Lingus again."	0
"SVO-PVG-SVO. Quite new Airbus 330-300 with sufficient inflight entertainment (if its working). Seats very poor actually with much less space than on the A320 I flew to Moscow with. Cabin crew generally never smile and disappear after lunch. Though my personal entertainment system was not working and my seat was broken no one apologized all I got from the stewardess was an unfriendly ""yes its broke"" then she went away. If you're on a budget Aeroflot long haul might be an option but be aware that you'll suffer big time for the 200€ you save. The difference to Aeroflot short haul European flights could not be more striking."	0
SVO-JFK-SVO. Loved the inflight entertainment. Selection of movies was superb all new movies. Food was good and seats were horrible - very small and uncomfortable. Could hardly sleep and that's for 8 hrs direct flight.	0
Last minute surprise cancellations and huge delays are routine in Aerolineas Argentinas. My short vacation last long weekend was ruined by this airline. Both flights BUE-COR and return COR-BUE were cancelled. In the first I returned to fly next day. In the second (COR-BUE) they sent me by bus (800km). Check with a knowledgeable and honest travel agent before becoming their hostage.	0
Flew 4 legs from Santiago to Iguazu. First one cancelled and we took next flight 3 hours later. Second one was delayed. The same with third flight. The last one also delayed before we could board and once onboard we had to stay sitting in the plane at Buenos Aires airport for more than an hour in a very warm day.	0
BRU-SVO-PVG in Economy. BRU-SVO on a small airbus no inflight entertainment and the staff's ability to speak English was average with a smile every now and then. I got a small warm meal for the 3.5 hours flight. Transfer at SVO airport was below average. Friendliness was unknown. SVO-PVG on a brand new A330 with decent leg room and various movies and music on individual inflight entertainment system. I got 2 warm meals though only drinks during meals and not in between. PVG-SVO - old Boeing 767 no adaptive head rests small leg room very little seat recline and no individual inflight entertainment. On boarding I went to sleep so missed the menu card. During mealtime I asked what was provided and got an extremely rude answer. No smile tossing objects at me instead of handing over - very disappointed by service. In general I wouldn't recommend.	0
LHR-to Dubai via Moscow. Moscow to Dubai the planes were old with no inflight entertainment. My friend ordered vegetarian food before the flight however she ended up with no inflight meal both ways. If your flight is long haul then I would not recommend this airline. For shorter distances it is fine. General staff service was poor and none could speak other languages apart from Russian. Limited food and if you required a drink you needed to help yourself at the end of the aircraft.	0
I recently flew from Athens to Milan. One extra bag cost 325 Euro. I could have purchased two tickets providing for two adults with bags for each less expensive. The counter agents were disinterested and responded to each other in Greek which I do not understand. This practice is unreasonable and unacceptable.	0
Tried to fly Dushanbe to Almaty to Bishkek. Almaty to Bishkek flight cancelled at last minute - no idea why (heard several explanations ranging from technical issues to lack of passengers). No notification from Astana staff until three hours later. I didn't have visa for Kazakhstan so forced to stay in airport transit lounge overnight. Next day tried to get visa at airport so I could drive to Bishkek. Air Astana people completely unhelpful - said it was impossible. Said I could either stay in airport another night until the next flight or fly to Bishkek via Moscow. Persisted and argued. Finally managed to talk to consulate at airport and received visa and took car to Bishkek. Air Astana refused to refund ticket or pay for visa.	0
"We have scheduled to fly 6 legs on this airline and unfortunately have flown 7. Five flights were delayed by over an hour and delays averaged 2 hours late. Each time the website reported an on-time takeoff when we checked prior to departing for the airport. The last time we flew this airline we checked the status prior to departure and it stated ""on-time"" for our flight from AEP to GIG. When we arrived at the airport the screens stated ""on-time"" finally after an hour in a line that did not move we noticed a crowd at one ticket counter and went to investigate. Our flight had been cancelled without an announcement. They rebooked us for a flight that left from a different airport and that took a detour through Sao Paulo. Our more expensive direct flight from AEP to GIG turned into a 13 hour marathon with us arriving in Rio de Janeiro seven hours late at 2:30 am in the morning. I will not fly this airline again."	0
Flew domestic with Aerolineas Argentinas on 5 occasions in the space of 3 weeks. Flight length was between 2 and 3hours each time. On every occasion the flight departure was at least 45mins or more delayed. Planes were generally older (late 80's early 90's) MD-90's. Inflight entertainment is non existent and the food served well below average. The problem in Argentina is that apart from the occasional LAN route Aerolineas sit on the whole domestic market so there is generally no choice of carrier.	0
I had the misfortune to fly this airline Sydney to Buenos Aires landed in Auckland where the plane had a mechanical problem no communication left waiting at the airport for hours before our tour guide got them to provide accommodation for the night. The plane we flew was very old had no inflight entertainment and the crew were rude. The flight crew left the seat belt sign on for most of the flight. My advice - give them a wide berth.	0
In May 2015 I caught the flight from Chicago O'Hare to Berlin Tegel. The aircraft was an Airbus 330. I was allocated a window seat but had no window. A woman who had paid an extra $50 for a window found herself in the same position but was not given a window. The aircraft was very overheated and had no individual air vents above the seats. The individual lights above my seat illuminated my neighbour rather than my seat. There were inadequate numbers of toilets for the large number of passengers. This resulted not only in severe discomfort for passengers but the water supply ran out in the toilet closest to me resulting in toilet paper not being flushed. The food was as cheap and nasty as I have ever had in Economy. I am not tall but had very little leg room. I could do very little work not only due to the shortage of space but the intense heat of the aircraft. The TV and movie selection was OK but not great but the TV screen in the back of the seat in front of me kept skipping or freezing every time the passenger in that seat vibrated the seat - extremely irritating. On approach to Berlin droplets of water started to drip on me and the passengers around me. On arrival the aircraft parked a very long distance from the terminal building. We were bussed to the terminal - this took about 10 minutes. We were then kept on the bus for another 10 minutes before being released into fresh air. The terminal for Air Berlin at Tegel turned out to be a shed with only 4 customs officers for hundreds of non-EU passengers. It took about an hour in a line to clear customs. (EU passengers cleared in minutes due to their automated passport readers.) I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and ended up on Air Berlin because it is a One World partner with QANTAS. How Air Berlin managed to join that partnership of good to excellent airlines is a mystery only the executives of those airlines can answer. I will be complaining to QANTAS and Air Berlin directly. The small number of flight attendants worked very hard and were pleasant but I felt sorry for them.	0
Terrible experience - we flew Buenos Aires to Ushuaia and returned 3 weeks later. Both time the flight was delayed by 5 hours. They seem to cancel flights until the plane is full and then let it go. Cabin staff and ground staff could not care less a very poor attitude. Horror stories from many other passengers about lost luggage. I would avoid using them at all cost.	0
Amsterdam to Hanoi with a stop in Moscow. Delay in Amsterdam because of overbooking and stranded in Moscow. Now one day later I'm still in Moscow. Aeroflot gave explanation. Together with 10 other people we were guarded to a non visa area in a nearby hotel. We received no communication no new boarding pass and service is lacking. We're not even allowed to leave our hotel room. No sign of Aeroflot within the last 36 hours! The hotel guard explains that lost passengers arrive here every day and that this is very common. The whole service is horrible but the worst part is that really nobody cares! Don't expect any service or any communication. We also didn't received our luggage although it's still here at the airport.	0
Booked a flight back home to Abu Dhabi from Berlin with Air Berlin not by choice as I actually booked it through Etihad Airways. The whole experience left me rather bitter and I really don't see the value add from Etihad Airways in partnering with Air Berlin. The following were my experiences with Air Berlin: 1) Couldn't reserve a seat on Air Berlin since my reservation code was tied to Etihad's. Had to make a call to Air Berlin but the initial response from them was to call back Etihad since they couldn't see my reservation in their system. However Etihad told me to call them back again since the flight was to be operated by them and they should see it in their system. After calls to-and-fro Air Berlin managed to retrieve my reservation and assist to reserve a seat (which came with a fee). 2) Baggage limit was only at 23kg. My outbound flight from Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt which was operated by Etihad Airways itself was 30kg. So I had to pay for the excess since I needed to bring back lots of stuff back from my trip. To make things worse the counter at Tegel Airport could not accept my credit cards apparently again because the reservation code was tied to Etihad's and so the payment couldn't be booked to release my boarding pass. So I made a mad dash to withdraw cash and had to go to a Baggage Service counter in exchange for a receipt since Air Berlin does not handle cash. From this experience I will not consider Air Berlin for long-haul flights anymore (being charged for seat reservation and low baggage limit) as there are many other alternatives that can provide more value and cost savings. Nor will I fly with any of the Etihad Airways partners anymore since their systems don't seem to be well-linked up with each other.	0
SYD to EZE via AKL EZE-BOG via LIM and return. Arrived at Sydney airport at 7am for a morning departure to be told flight will be delayed until afternoon. Provided with a lunch voucher I spent the day at Sydney airport flight finally departed at around 1730. Arriving late to EZE I had missed my prebooked hotel shuttle and complained at the airline counter and they gave me a voucher for a hire car to my hotel which was nice. A340 was old seats were well worn and frayed overhead reading lights didn't work overhead baggage lockers difficult to close ancient entertainment system with flickering screen. Food was passable but nothing special cabin crew looked old and tired and mostly stayed in the galley chatting amongst themselves and were not very attentive. The pillow was so small and flat it was a waste of time as was the small think blanket. Every other flight I had within South America with this airline was very late causing inconvenience and disruption to my travel plans. My return flight to Australia was cancelled and I was driven to a hotel and picked up by bus the next morning only to face more delays uncertainty and poor communication from airline staff. This airline is a joke listen to me and many other people here when we say pay the extra money and fly to South America with LAN or Qantas but avoid Aerolineas Argentinas like the plague.	0
Auckland to Sydney. On the way there flight was delayed almost two hours. Staff were rude requested a bassinet for my 3 month old When boarded plane was told there was nothing? Flight home delayed two hours again no bassinet. Staff did not smile when needed pressed the button and waited 20 minutes?	0
I flew from Stockholm (ARN) to New York (JFK) via Berlin on March 29th (AB 8003 and AB 7248). The first stretch was 30 min late and I was forced to run through the terminals to get to my departure gate for JFK. I received no support or information from AB. Upon arrival at the gate I was informed that there was a 5 hour delay for the JFK flight. There was no information on the cause of the delay and staff appeared to be very confused. After 4 hours it was announced that there was another hour delay. The flight finally left over 6 hours behind schedule. The only compensation we received was a bottle of water and bag of chips. The return flight on April 2nd (AB 7249) was also delayed. Originally the delay was 40 min and then turned into over an hour. I therefore missed my connection back to Stockholm and was booked on a flight 4 hours later. The only compensation was again a bottle of water and bag of chips. The quality of the service once the plane was airborne was quite good and the entertainment system excellent (when it worked I was unlucky enough to have a malfunctioning screen on the return flight). In conclusion if you can afford to arrive late then the low ticket prices can make this airline attractive. However I will never fly them again given this rather miserable experience. The combined delays cost me over 10 hours of my life.	0
Plane from Auckland to Buenos Aires was old pocket at back of seat was split so mags etc kept falling out seats frayed and the nearest movie screen didn't work. Inflight service OK there doesn't seem to be a choice of meal and it is just plonked in front of one. But had plenty of room as plane was only half full. Return trip from Montivideo was hours late leaving for Buenos Aires. I had to take a bus to the international airport but as it wouldn't have arrived there till 0100 I had to take a car (shared with another traveller) for the 0200 flight which left at 0430! Plane was better than the first as everything seemed to work. Cabin staff do their job but not so friendly as other air lines. Lights out after dinner and don't see cabin staff much after that but there is water and drinks left in the galley area. Plane late into Auckland so therefore missed connection to Christchurch and had to buy another ticket as I had just got a non transferable thinking 3 hours between flights would be long enough. Air fare was about half the price of the other airline servicing that route. Not sure if I will use them again. Have to be aware of delays and we were not given any explanation as to why it was delayed.	0
Atyrau-Almaty-Bangkok. Atyrau-Almaty flight cancelled without explanation on the day making us stay in Atyrau for additional 2 days without offering accommodation. Replacement flight delayed twice. After we an hour in a check-in queue we were told that they ran out of seats on the plane leaving us and about 20 other passengers stranded. Offered tickets on additional flight on the same day but it was late to get on the connecting flight in Almaty. After 4 hours told that the additional flight was delayed. At 11pm it was announced that the flight was cancelled so we attempted to rebook. Told the next available flight was in 2 days which was unacceptable and we bought tickets with another airline. The next day we flew to Almaty with another airline and got on our connecting flight to Bangkok. As a result of the issues with Air Astana flights we had to spend extra money on the flights in Kazakhstan and Thailand.	0
Buenos Aires to Madrid - flight delayed 9 hours. Then 15 days later I flew from Rome to Buenos Aires the flight was again delayed 10 hours.	0
"Seat room in economy is tight on the return flight (7 hours 20 mins) our baggage was mistakenly brought to the cargo area instead of baggage claim. We were given no explanation as to why after an hour our bags were still not dispensed. The staff had no idea even where the bags were! After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that ""we at least know where the bags are"". Exhausted after now a total of 10 hrs a meal voucher was given out when all we wanted was the be on our way! The whole experience was handled very poorly!"	0
Birmingham to Cork out 29th return 30th January. Flight took off on time but hit heavy winds on approach aborted landing and circled for approx 40 minutes before diverted to Shannon. Bussed to Cork. Return flight on 30th January very much the same. When approaching Birmingham told that aircraft was outside it landing limits with the weather. Aircraft circled for approx 1 hour over Birmingham tried to land and aborted then diverted to Luton. Again bussed back to Birmingham 4 hrs late. Why do they use this type of aircraft this time of year which is close or outside it operating limits. Surely pilots have accurate weather predictions.	0
FCO-DME-SHA. Flight delay - 3 hours on departure. Missed connecting flight in Moscow with consequently overnight in Moscow. The food is very heavy and the crew unpleasant. It's cheaper than other airlines but you get low quality service.	0
Travelled Berlin TXL to Abu Dhabi on A330-200. First of all shame on Etihad for partnering with such a budget airline and expect all of its loyal customers to put up with it - it has severely damaged the prestige it had built up over the years. Air Berlin is essentially a German budget airline operated out of a budget hub with a cheap meal and a poor IFE thrown in all awhile pretending to be a full service airline wearing the Etihad badge. Flight crew are very basic leg room is extremely minuscule - like other budget airlines meal is tiny and unappetising. Worse of all even for inter-continental flights you've got to pay nearly 40 Euros to select your seat! Never heard of it! All in all I am extremely unhappy with what Air Berlin had to offer both pre and during flight. I am taking my money else where the next time I am heading back to Europe. Bye Etihad and your budget subsidiary.	0
Air Berlin operated the 6 hour flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi for the partner airline Etihad. Firstly it was delayed 2.5 hours due to having to unload luggage of a passenger that failed to board. This meant that the flight would arrive into Abu Dhabi 30 minutes after boarding would commence for the connecting Etihad flight to Perth. Crew refused to advise if the connection flight would wait for us saying that Etihad had not contacted them therefore they didn't know. If they are partner airline and operating the service on behalf of Etihad and are responsible for the delay surly it is their responsibility to contact Etihad or surely there is a some agreement between the two carriers for situation such as this! We were told that ground staff would advise and assist on arrival in Abu Dahbi. But there was no ground staff who knew anything about the flight to Perth and no ground staff willing to help. Luckily the connecting flight was delayed for other reason and we made it but the airline did nothing to ease our minds. On the flight itself the crew were rude abrupt and just generally unpleasant. The food was worse than terrible. The hot food was served in a plastic-lined container the taste of which went all through the food. The only good thing about the flight was the seats - they reclined further and are possibly wider than most economy seats that I have sat in. I was very comfortable and slept well.	0
Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires. Aerolineas Argentinas now offers service to Aeroparque which is more convenient than Ezeiza. We bought business class tickets. Check-in staff at GRU tells us that aircraft assigned to flight has all-coach cabin offers refund. Same happens on the way back. Strong suggestion that Aerolineas Argentinas is selling tickets to non-existent business class seats.	0
Our flight was late arriving in Ho Chi Min for our flight to Moscow with no apology from the crew. They let passengers onto the flight who had been drinking heavily and nothing was said or done to turn them away the crew were unhelpful and sullen the food was inedible. On arriving in Moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to London Heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. When we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a Hotel for the night. No apologies there was a lot of shrugging of shoulders and being told to sit over there. Rude and very unhelpful.	0
Copenhagen-Dusseldorf-Miami both ways with my family (wife and three kids). Service on board was not as we expected. Some of the personnel was unfriendly and not very understanding concerning families with kids. There was a delay on our way from Miami to Dusseldorf were we sat for 3 hours in the plane and the only thing that they offered was a protein bar. Food on the plane was not so good and we had to buy some snacks to the kids. The entertainment system on the longer flight of 11 hours was not working well and there were no helps from the personnel or alternatives. The delayed flight home had us miss the connection flight and we had to wait for 12 hours in the airport since the company did not use the 10-11 hours we were in the air to try and find alternatives for passengers with connection flights. The ground personnel said they only knew it 10 minutes before we landed in Dusseldorf. This is according to my view not a professional way of running a customer focused company. We will never travel with Air Berlin again.	0
SVO-CPH. First time with Aeroflot and would avoid in the future. Surly and unpleasant cabin crew. Very average food and almost incomprehensible announcements in English. Fortunately the flight was only just over two hours.	0
Flew Madrid to Berlin. Very ordinary experience. Flight departed bang on time. Crew were friendly and smiling which is always nice to see. We were offered a free non-alcoholic beverage and a bag of chips or gingerbread. They put on a few videos for the 3 hour flight but no headphones were offered. No meals were offered for purchase even though this was mentioned by the crew at departure. I'd recommend you take snacks. We were offered a small delicious chocolate heart as we got off the plane. We had to walk down stairs in the rain and be taken by bus to the terminal. Had to wait ages for our luggage. Is this the 1980s? Seemed like there were plenty of empty aerobridges. No explanation was offered. Wouldn't recommend this airline. Not sure how they ever made it into OneWorld?	0
I flew from Milan to Berlin round-trip and have to say that after several bad experiences with Air Berlin this time they were over the point. I booked the flight from Malpensa to Tegel and some weeks later they changed the airport from Malpensa to Linate which is further from where I live. This was just the beginning. On the flight back from Tegel to Linate although I was at the check in desk on time (70 mins in advance) they told me that I could not fly because the flight was overbooked! This was the evening flight and they offered me the chance to fly the next morning instead. They offered me another alternative to fly to Linate via Dusseldorf. So I went back to the Air Berlin desk where they gave me a new boarding pass. After finally arriving at Linate 3 hours later than initially planned what completed the disaster is that my luggage did not arrive. Never again.	0
Was scheduled to connect at London Heathrow to an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin. American Airlines flight from the US was late and missed connecting flight. Aer Lingus would not honor ticket and required new tickets to be bought. Ticket agent was rude. Approached Aer Lingus office in Dublin who were unhelpful. Return ticket and check in agent in Dublin was rude and testy. A truly rotten experience.	0
Amsterdam to Hanoi via Moscow. The first flight delayed an hour making me miss the connecting flight in Moscow to Hanoi. Had to spend the night in the airport hotel. The next day I had to fly to Beijing wait 5 hrs and finally catch my flight to Vietnam. All in all I was delayed 34 hrs. Onboard staff were not very friendly and their English pretty bad. The food was average and seats and inflight entertainment adequate for economy class.	0
We flew from Berlin to Abu Dhabi Business Class. The flight was late in Berlin and 40 minutes late on arrival at Abu Dhabi. Missed our next flight to Bangkok. The seats are narrow and for tall persons it is impossible to sleep. The meal is not worth talking about. The cabin crew were friendly.	0
Abu Dhabi to Berlin what a horror joined a long line which snaked out of the door into the duty free area the long line was caused by lack of security screening facilities. Once past security people are compressed into a small area whilst buses transfer you to the aircraft another painfully slow process. Once on board you get to witness some of the worse leg room in economy in the industry. It the took 1 hour to taxi out to take off unbelievable at 0200 in the morning get with the picture Abu Dhabi airport. Once airborne crew come through the aircraft in the dark to serve substandard food. Disembarking in Berlin passport control is at the end of the aerobridge so the line goes back towards the aircraft door and if your a non EU passport holder you can't even get to the line for that counter as the majority EU residents are blocking the path. Once through that process you wait in a small luggage claim area for your bags to eventually arrive! What a horrible experience from start to finish.	0
Flight Almaty - Bishkek December 9th 2012. Horrible experience! All passengers boarded as scheduled by 10pm. Due to weather conditions we were informed we would have to wait. We were kept on the plane from 9.30pm until 4.30am. No reliable info provided by the staff/pilot. No food provided. At 4.30am we were asked to leave the plane and return to the terminal where we were informed that the flight was cancelled and the next one would be in 2 days. Ground staff rude and incompetent. No-one cared to provide us with snacks and hot beverages.	0
Once again another delay on the Birmingham - Cork route! I've flown 3 times in the last 12 months and on each occasion I've experience a delay on 2 occasions in excess of 3 hours (flight time is under 1.5 hours!). Today's flight due to leave Birmingham at 17.15 but message board revealed ETD 21.00. I wasn't prepared to wait that long and went home. As usual no explanation for the delay and nobody around to ask!	0
BUD-SVO-KJA (roundtrip). Aeroflot inflight service was fine although staff could have been better trained and their English command was poor. Transfer in SVO is the Europe worst with the most confusing pointers impossibly slow passport control bizarre security check and no interest from staff to make the transfer more comfortable.	0
I flew yesterday from Vienna to Munich and the flight was shared with Niki. Upon arrival at the airport I found that the flight was cancelled. I was given a choice to either fly via Berlin and arrive late in the evening in Munich or wait for the 18:30 flight direct to Munich. I opted for the direct flight and then had the five and a half hour wait at the airport. The 18:30 flight was then one hour delayed as they had mechanical problems. So instead of arriving at the arrival time of 16:00 I arrived at 20:30 in Munich. This is the second time this has happened to me with Air Berlin in the last three months. The previous time I was flying to Milan and I had to spend the night in Dusseldorf as I missed the connecting flight. The ground staff in Munich were completely unhelpful and only the staff in Dusseldorf did an excellent job and were very helpful. I will certainly not fly AirBerlin again. The only compensation I received in the first instance was a five euro drink voucher!	0
DUS-AUH AB 7460 on 17 October. Flew AB short-haul quite a lot but first time long-haul. Much less positive than previous times. It started with a very grumpy attendant at luggage drop off. No welcome no eye contact just orders. Man must hate his job. Same attitude at gate while boarding. On board less legspace food bad and no pre- ordered vegetarian meal. Flight attendants robotic but that's AB. Movie choice limited. On the positive side: very punctual performance. But on long haul AB is not on par with other carriers like Lufthansa. Chose AB because of direct flight and departure time but will probably shift to another carrier next time. Lots of choice to the UAE.	0
Economy on ZRH-DUS and DUS-AUH. The planes were new but considering this is a European airline why did they design the seats with so little legroom? Everyone suffered when the the person in front started to recline seats. Limited choice on inflight entertainment. The experience on both flights were horrible and we would never want to fly with this airline again. Avoid this airline at all cost.	0
I will never fly Air Botswana again. Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again. I could not be more appalled at the way Air Botswana operates.	0
I am a 1.8 million miler with Delta and have flown millions of miles with almost every Airline in the world in Economy Business and First Class. We recently paid $10000 for two Business Class Tickets from LAX to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin because we wanted to fly on the same air line as family members returning form a visit - never again Air Berlin. It took more than combined 14+ hrs on hold on the phone to confirm our flights. They never answers our various email complaint forms I filled out. Their business class seats are small just like Comfort Economy seat  even so the decline to a full bed but you may fall out when you turn around. Food is average and overall service ranges form very bad to average. Never again.	0
My wife and I recently flew from Munich to Berlin-Tegel then Berlin-Tegel to Paris-Orly. The connection was only 40 minutes so we knew things were going to be tight but that's how AB booked us. Things went downhill fast when some genius in ground services let 4 band members board the plane with their instruments (guitars etc). It was a full flight and I'm sure everyone here knows how little room there is in the overhead lockers these days. Where did they ever think these guys would be stashing their guitars etc? Anyway surprise surprise there was nowhere to stow them and the passengers were offloaded. Delay caused - 20 minutes plus. Then when we arrived at Berlin we were informed that the connecting flight was aware of the delay and to make our way to the gate as quickly as possible. Problem was the connecting flight was leaving from another terminal which meant a 500 odd meter dash and another set of security check points. Luckily my wife and I are moderately fit and got there reasonably quickly. I looked at the plane through the glass and could see it sitting there with stairs still in place. I presented our boarding passes to a very disinterested woman slumped behind the desk. She casually scoffed/explained that as we were late they had offloaded us and there was no way of getting on the flight. Knowing enough about the words 'offloaded' I didn't bother arguing and I realised there was no reversing the situation. We walked all the way back through security back to the other terminal and were told there was no way of getting to Paris that day as all flights were booked. They put us up in a cheap hotel in Berlin (without our checked baggage). Certainly the worst service I have experienced from an airline and not one I would risk again by flying them in the future.	0
Abu Dhabi to Phuket AB7424. My husband and I flew from Heathrow with Etihad and they were brilliant and can't fault the flight but from Abu Dhabi to Phuket it was awful on Air Berlin. No leg space and when the seat in front reclined you couldn't eat your meal or view the poor selection of video. We had one poor meal which consisted of a roll and not very appetising considering this was a six hour flight this was appaling we only had one hot drink with this I asked for a hot drink later and was told brusquely no. Our roll was practically thrown at us as well. Customer service was non-existent. Etihad need to reconsider their flight partner as this has put us off.	0
Cork-Glasgow route (operated by Aer Arann) on 24th Oct - not a pleasant experience. Flight was 2hrs late leaving - explanation given was the plane was late arriving. Departing Glasgow on 29th Oct was again nearly 2 hrs late (no explanation given on this occasion). Every time I have used this route it is delayed and speaking with other passengers I am not alone! The aircraft is always dirty - coffee spills down the seats/walls seem to be a permanent fixture and added to that the dirty magazines and paper wrappings left behind in the seat pockets. If I had a choice I certainly would not recommend this route to anyone.	0
SVO-LAX NYC-SVO. Both A330's interior looked run down and seats were dirty. Toilets were not cleaned during the flight. The food almost the same as I had two days before on a SVO-MUC-SVO.	0
Aug 23 from JFK to TXL and again on Sep 03 from TXL to JFK. Our Eastbound take-off was delayed 2.25 hours due to “ mechanical difficulties but the flight going back to JFK arrived a few minutes early. AB has a problem with space which is in short supply. I am average height and weight yet I could not walk in the aisles without turning sideways. A passenger in front me on the Eastbound flight reclined her seat and made the space issue more critical. Seats are narrow and seat belts date back to 1968. Staff are friendly and polite but refuse to recognize that some passengers do not understand German. Food quality surpassed my expectations saluting the American Cuisine on the Eastbound portion. The meal quality on the Westbound portion surpassed that of Business Class food on other carriers!	0
This was my second time on AB after a short flight to Crete in 1997. To make a long story short - the 2 biggest issues were: The narrow space between the seats Ryanair has more space! That would be OK on a 2-3 hours flight but not 12 hours (TXL-AUH-HKT and back). Terrible. I am 1.88m and did not know how to sit. Customer service: I do not know if the flight attendants earn enough or have zero training because they have no idea about customer service. At the end of the day I do not care - I want the best service for my money and I have to say that I have never - and I have been to almost 80 countries - experienced such unprofessional often rude stewards. Two examples: I ordered special meals and on 2 of the 4 flights there were problems with it and the AB staff screamed the information about my special meal throughout the cabin. I went to the kitchen for a second beer. The lady gave me a lecture in a very rude undertone that the supplies have to suffice for the return flight from HKT to AUH as well. All this and more has never happened to me before. The result for me is: AB and AUH never ever again. AUH is a mess too - everything is totally unorganised and everything works like on a bazaar. I know DXB and DOH as well. DXB and EK are the best and I love to use them.	0
Moscow DME to Saint Petersburg. Check in was easy. Friendly smiling cabin staff who could communicate at a basic level in English. They passed out candy before takeoff and a mid-flight snack of tea/coffee apple juice and some sort of wafer dessert - distributed newspapers as well. Seating was comfortable with plenty of room.	0
Seoul-Moscow-Warsaw return. Great fare (just 845USD roundtrip) great food onboard. Some delays on both legs but that didn't bother me much. Good news is that Moscow airport has been renewed Wi-Fi and clean air (smoking allowed only in special cabins). They've banned alcohol on board so no more drunk passengers and fights for seats!	0
Maun-Johannesburg. Short 90 min flight on what appeared to be newer BAE 146. Interior had nice leather seats and the legroom seemed quite good for economy. The flight attendants seemed indifferent (almost as they were being bothered) as they just plodded through the flight. The only problem with the flight was the hot cabin. I had to ask the flight attendant twice before the temperature was lowered to less than an inferno. Apparently on the BAE 146 the cockpit controls the cabin temperature - not the cabin crew.	0
Air Botswana to and from Johannesburg and Maun. The staff were friendly and outward journey JNB-Main was fine. The return journey was chaos! To start with the check-in at Maun airport was chaotic. The lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in. Air Botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight. Once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldn't take our bags and that they would be in JNB on the next flight (apparently 2 hours later). I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldn't take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow! At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun. He took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we weren't staying in Johannesburg. I honestly didn't expect to see my bag again. Three days later at home in Spain an Air Botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in Spain I want my bag sent to! Zaragoza is 1.5 hours drive away and the nearest airport. My bag arrived there 2 days later. If any other airline flew between Main and Johannesburg I would try them. I think Air Botswana needs some competition!	0
"3 flights over 2 weeks (Almaty-Astana Astana-Almaty Almaty-Delhi). Computers at check in down no assigned seating every man for himself. Quite tall had reserved exit row was told to ""stand at the gate"" to be the first one on to grab the seat. However they boarded 20 people into coach ahead of us and the exit rows ended up being filled by families with kids. Changed ticket received confirmation via email arrive at airport to be informed ""Yes we sent a confirmation but you needed to come to our office to get the ticket."" Upon informing them that they sent the e-mail at 10 pm and the office would be closed they informed me I should have driven from central Astana to the airport to do it. Entire day wasted in Astana airport eventually placed on a late afternoon totally packed flight. Guaranteed exit row instead given tiny seat with zero leg room. Food absolutely dreadful. Staff spent most of their time sitting in the entirely empty Business Class section watching movies and telling passengers on the full flight not to use the Business Class bathroom."	0
Heathrow - Dublin - Heathrow same day return originally booked BA but missed flight so changed to EI fairly clean A320 in both directions fairly clean with adequate seat comfort and space. While it was a last minute booking I'm afraid the service offered for the £570 I paid for the return ticket was abysmal! Only a short 1hr flight but nothing in the way of service not even a glass of water without having to pay for it. The saving grace was because I bought a full fare Y ticket I was allowed to use the lounge both at Heathrow and Dublin which where ok.	0
We flew yesterday from Geneva to Dublin. The plane was two hours late; overhead luggage racks were full when we boarded and there were hefty charges for any food or drink aboard the flight. It also took unnecessarily long to serve passengers because the crew had to collect money and discuss food selections from all passengers who wished to eat or drink. There were no charges (yet) to use the toilets.	0
I just returned from a tradeshow in the Ukraine. Aeroflot offered the best fare and connections from Nice (via Moscow) so I took a chance - begrudgingly. Brand-new airbus aircraft smiling cabin crew leather seats and plenty of legroom. The crew came and greeted me to thank me for flying them - a nice touch. The food was good - even in Economy. Shrimp smoked salmon a lovely cod dish - very unexpected.	0
Maun to Jo'burg. Got on plane and when arrived in Jo'burg our luggage did not. No ones did. Found out afterwards that if it is hotter than 40C they will not take luggage if plane is full. Wish someone would have informed us. We didn't get our luggage back until Zanzibar 2 days later and many frustrating moments in between. Tired plane needs an overhaul or the insides redone. They had a quick stop (which was not on the itinerary or the ticket) in Gabone. It was to turn staff over or something but couldn't get off plane and the 10 minutes turned into 40 without AC doors opened and +40C.	0
JNB-MUB return. Tried to check in early in JNB and was told to come back later as the BP staff had not started working in the luggage area and the check in staff member thought our bags might get pilfered (liked his honesty). The flights both ways use the new ATR 2-2 seating which was comfortable and adequate. To MUB there was a sandwich service with drinks followed by a 2nd drinks service. From MUB there was just nuts with a drink service. On arrival we were told to sit till we were instructed to stand and they were very strict even after the door had been opened.	0
Maun to Johannesburg. What a terrible experience. The plane was in disarray  dirty. The cabin staff were dishevelled  not serious. I will never fly Air Botswana again!	0
Hard to rate Air Berlin as a whole since we never got on the plane. Our complaint is about the people who work at the Air Berlin counter in Zurich Switzerland. We arrived 40 min. before departure and were told that they couldn't check in our luggage because we were 20 min. late. We asked if they could send our luggage on the next flight we were told no because it must go with us. Our dilemma was to lose our luggage or lose the flight. They were very uncooperative and unhelpful to 2 old travelers. One would expect more from the personnel at the counter aren't they there to help us instead of causing more stress. We rushed to Swiss Air and they boarded us with 30 min. before departure with our luggage. That's what you call a helpful personnel and a good airline!	0
EI 638 to Brussels. Fly Aer Lingus about 2 times a month for both business and pleasure. Unfortunately not much pleasure flying with Aer Lingus and getting worse. At the gate there was a team of 5 identifying bags take off passengers and put in the hold. Despite my bag being within guidelines (I have measured it) it was confiscated. I was first told that it was too big when I challenged this I was told that it was a health safety risk and would not fit in the bin. Strange as the same bag has been on about 20 flights with EI. It was rude and humiliating treatment by the staff but based on many reviews here it is a common theme. When I got to my seat there was plenty of space in the bin. Arrived late into Brussels and then had a 40 minute wait for my hand luggage. People will be more forthcoming with bags if they are given back to passengers as they get off the plane - Air France and US carriers have no problems doing this If someone has a problem maybe it is because they have documents laptops etc which they would prefer not to go into the hold for obvious reasons. At this stage I will use Aer Lingus when I have to but if there is any reasonable alternative then I won't and certainly not for leisure flights. As an aside the cost of the flight was in excess of €500.	0
Heathrow to Shanghai via Moscow. London-Moscow flight was pleasant on a modern plane with plenty of leg room and as a short haul flight works well. However from landing in Moscow to reaching Shanghai was awful. Transit through Moscow is embarrassing - one desk with rude and unpleasant staff. I advise you to run off your plane if you have a quick connection because I have no doubt that they don't co-ordinate transit passengers and the plane would leave without you no effort made to fast-track those with short connections. One desk one security machine. The plane from Moscow to Shanghai was late and outdated with less legroom than the short haul flight from London no entertainment and food that was awful. Unfriendly cabin crew. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Yes it is cheap but there is a reason why it is cheap.	0
Paris CDG to Beijing Capital via Moscow Shemereteyevo. All flights were on time with good service on board. Inflight entertainment includes several films in French and meals were good. We flew A319 320 and 330 all in good condition.	0
Gaborone to Kasane and back. I found the aircraft to be fine - nothing spectacular but clean tidy and in order. Younger cabin crew staff tended to be friendlier and more outgoing whilst older employees seemed weary and even a little sullen. Inflight snack an odd cross between chicken sandwich and summer salad with neither emerging as distinct in itself. My overall impression was of an airline that does a functional job pretty solidly - no delays for me - but could probably add a little more to its approach to customer care. There are plenty worse in Africa!	0
Jo'burg-Maun-Jo'burg. Either we were lucky or Air Botswana are improving. BAe 146 in decent condition flights left on time and the crew were pleasant. The inflight snack was curious but as all Brit passengers are increasingly used to nothing at all this just isn't a problem. Given the flight time and distance our fares were reasonable though not cheap. May the improvement on our (and others') previous bad experiences continue.	0
I travel Air Botswana frequently for trips around the country (as there is no other carrier) and what I cannot understand is the extremly high cost for tickets. I understand they have a monopoly but $500 for a 2 hour flight is absurd! When they do have 'specials' you can call the day they are announced only to find out those cheap seats have already been filled. And their prices compared to SA for flights to Joburg are also incredibly high ($400 for a 1 hour flight). So high that we never fly to Joburg but opt to drive for 4 hours and spend a night in a hotel which works out to a big cost savings although not a time saver. The staff are adequate (although customer service in all of Botswana is poor so it is adequate compared to that baseline)  but not the food. And the flights are frequently late especially leaving from Joburg to Gabs.	0
I have just returned from Botswana - my 6th visit to this lovely friendly country- and must strongly disagree with the comments regarding the quality of the cabin crew . I have always found them to be models of friendly efficient and helpful service. They seem to epitomise the character of the people I have met in Botswana- a ready smile and a genuine concern to help if they can. Air Botswana has an important role in representing this rapidly developing country- yes they must update their aircraft but they have a priceless asset - their staff. Take note Air France  Emirates with your indifferent customer relations.	0
Flew business class from Berlin to Abu Dhabi. Outbound flight in the evening was good. Service was great. Flat beds great. Food was pretty poor though. I've tasted better 99p microwave made meals. Inbound flight - flat beds great. Service was awful. I echo comments made here about attendants wanting to get the job over and done with as quickly as possible. On top of that the breakfast was without a doubt the worst breakfast I have ever tasted. A McDonalds McMuffin is fine dining in comparison. So good hard product. Mediocre soft product.	0
Dubai-Almaty-Ust-Kamenogorsk-Astana-Dubai. Later part of May - beginning June 2010. Flight to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty not too bad or unpleasant considering I was en route already for 25 days (spending 18 hours in horrible Dubai Airport). My suitcase was damaged by rough handling. The flight Ust-Kamenogorsk to Astana was not bad either. Astana-Dubai flight started with a hiccup - since the customs people did not know where Namibia is and I was looked at very suspiciously despite having a private Visa and being with my Kazakhstan wife. The flight was very unpleasant - seats the most uncomfortable for such a flight! Attendants not interested in making the flight a wee-bit more comfortable. Prices not too bad - however flying to the destinations I need to go to there is no alternative to compare. Being the national airline there is much room for improvement.	0
Budapest to Dublin on a packed flight early September. We were greeted at check in by the advice that wife's bag was 3 kg over and even though we had only one carry on bag well below 7kg no leeway was allowed. Aer Lingus is the only airline we experienced in 15 international flights that has a 20kg (not 23kg) hold baggage limit. To determine whether or not they are value for money I now routinely add $50 (that's what 3kg cost me) to their fares when I compare them. Food was non-existent so it's not easy to rate it.	0
Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.	0
After using United for many years on my trips from the US to Berlin I was excited to try Air Berlin. The fare was more than UA but I decided to try them. Mistake! The crew on my ORD to TXL flight seemed interested only in getting the service over with ASAP. The food was terrible and served ungraciously. The seats are hard and more cramped than on UA (I did not opt to pay extra for an XXL seat since I'm 5'2 and weigh 98lbs I didn't think I needed it). On my return TXL to ORD the fight experience a mechanical problem resulting in a 2 hr delay. The ground staff made an unintelligible announcement and then retreated behind a glass partition where no one could ask them anything. Again on board service was without a single smile. Same terrible presentation and lacklustre service. I will not be using Air Berlin again.	0
A terrible business class lounge. I had to pay for everything except water and cola. They have launched a web check-in service but do not have a terminal to print the boarding pass at the airport. I find it rather uncomfortable due to the fact that you can't often find a printer when traveling on business trips. On my last trip I've checked-in online printed my boarding pass but I have learned that my seat doesn't exist because they've changed the plane. I've found it out only when I was onboard. Maybe not so terrible but not too good.	0
"Flew with them yesterday Alicante to Belfast. I travel that route a lot due to work commitments and have rated theirs the best service in the past (compared to rivals Easyjet and Jet2). However the legroom on the Airbus 319 last night was simply dreadful. Ok I'm 6'3"" but have never had such a problem with them before. My knees were jammed into the seat back in front of me and I couldn't get comfortable. 3 hours of that discomfort and I was ready to scream. I checked the website to see how to complain and I have to do it in writing - no email address is provided. How very convenient (for them not a complainant) Add to that the fact that my first two drink choices (none too demanding - a can of Fanta and then a can of Diet Coke ) were sold out and I'm less than impressed. It appears that due to their move from Belfast International to Belfast City airport they're dumping the Alicante route shortly - on the basis of last night's experience I won't miss them."	0
Connecting flight from DUS to DUB and DUB to DUS no business class available even when booked for the whole flight to BOS that means no lounge in DUS. Female Personnel on board from DUB- DUS (not at the terminal) was disinterested to rude the word please was unknown. The staff were busy on both flights immediately after take off to prepare coffee and sandwiches for their needs and only one had to perform the sales!	0
"New York-Moscow to Delhi return. On our way to Moscow we found the flight attendants to be rude and unhelpful (and of course not smiling). During the 7 hr layover we became concerned about the mere 1 hr layover on our return trip. It sounded good when we booked it but realizing that we would have to run through security and the length of the airport to get to our flight we didn't think it would be possible. We stopped to ask a woman behind a customer service desk and she said ""yes not enough time"" waved her hand at us and we were dismissed. Getting onto the plane to Delhi we realized our seats were not together. We once again tried to get an answer and was ignored. Very unhelpful and rude. For the return flight we had to change flights in the office in Delhi. Come to find out that there was another flight out of Moscow with a 3 hour layover. We switched to that flight. The office workers in Delhi were also cold and rude. As it turns out by the time we landed from Delhi in Moscow and got to the terminal to fly out that 1 hour layover flight had already left. We would have been stranded in Moscow for who know how long because nobody would have acknowledged our existence let alone get us onto a flight. Oh and did I mention I had ordered veg. meals? On the way to Delhi I did receive delicious meals on the return flights no such luck. I had bread."	0
"I flew the OSL-TXL route on an A320. The plane was packed but the staff still did a great job. They gave a Air Berlin - The Ryanair of the One World alliance just plain poor. Having flown TXL-SOF return here is my experience. I am a top tier OneWorld member and fly all the time but AB are by far the worst member of OW. Their hub airport Berlin Tegel (TXL). Without doubt the worst hub airport in Europe easily surpassing chronically bad airports like LHR. It is a series of temporary buildings and metal huts connected by temporary walkways. Grossly overcrowded with massive deficiencies in service such as bathrooms restaurants seating areas etc. Those they do have are dirty. AB check in is often crowded and has long lines security was OK. But wait I am a top tier member so I can use their lounge right? Yes sir it is past security. OK I have 2 hours to kill I get to the lounge and there is no attendant there is an automated card swipe machine to enter that only accepts AB status cards. Eventually a man appears I explain I am an emerald member sorry you can't get in must have an AB card no override or personnel available. Now for you USA fliers that have a US sized carry on this gets a frown of disapproval from AB staff I was asked to check mine. Except they lost it from SOF-TXL. Inflight service on this 2 hour cramped seat pitch was a drink and a ""sweet or salty"" snack. I am done with AB - I'll connect through Madrid Helsinki or London thanks."	0
"The comments about this airline mostly relate to their international flights and I understand that they offer a good service there. It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had ""tried to contact me"" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much. I've given 1 rather than 0 as the Almaty to Bishkek ""return"" flight itself wasn't bad. Their ground service and support in these regional centres very much needs to upgraded to the same standard as their flight experience."	0
We flew from Bournemouth to Dublin. At check in we were told that our bags were too big to go on as hand luggage in spite of the fact that they are the same bags we have always used. We were charged £24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.	0
"EY1996 AUH-HKT June 4th. Absolutely appalling customer service from the very rude and miserable ""flight attendants"" cramped seats awful food. We were given a (what they called) sandwich which was half the size of the palm of my hand and bottle of water this constituted a 'meal' just woeful. The people who run this airline should be embarrassed to be associated with this below par sub standard outfit. Never again. If Ryan Air flew > long haul I'd rather go with them."	0
My wife and I had reservations on Air Berlin FCO-DUS/DUS-MUC AB8841/AB6031. The DUS-MUC flight was cancelled which in itself is not unusual. However the manner in which their personnel dealt with this was not at all professional. There were no clear announcements or directions on what we had to do nor on where to proceed to claim our luggage. Then after we secured our luggage there was the re-booking procedure. There was much time and frustration in this process and did not leave us with a good feeling about Air Berlin.	0
Air Berlin was fine going from ORD to TXL. Good service actually decent food. Booked an extra size seat. Beware of this. The seats that are by the window in the bulkhead do not have much space for your feet as there is a large boxed in area for the door when it is closed. Aisle seat is fine but window seat not. TXL has to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to. Slow bus service from the plane to the terminal. 2 passport agents for 100's of citizens. On the way back I could not find out where my flight was leaving from as I had made a connection and no one would help me. Poor signs. I had to exit the terminal walk two other terminal down on the street and then re-check in for my international flight. I had 55 minutes between flights and kept asking when I booked was this enough time. I was told YES - plenty. I barely made it and was the last person on the plane. Ran the whole way to the gate. Flight back was not so good. A bit of a surly flight attendant. The guy in front of me kept putting his seat totally back and I could not eat my dinner or even get out of my seat! I am a small person - this was crazy. I asked him for some assistance but even though he spoke English - he ignored me. Would I fly them again probably not.	0
"Air Berlin business class from Los Angeles to Berlin in May 2014. The first thing I noticed about Air Berlin business class: It's cramped. Very cramped. Air Berlin tries to sell the head-high dividers between its business class seats as ""even more privacy"" ""even more isolation"" and so on but in reality these are just flimsy plastic screens that fail to disguise the fact that Air Berlin has taken away about half the width of a ""normal"" business class seat and inserted another seat which is recessed so the other passenger's feet are sticking into your space. They manage to cleverly disguise this in their advertising by depicting only isolated seat units. In Air Berlin business class the feet of the person in the recessed seat next to you are a few inches away separated by a flimsy shaky plastic screen cutting into your space. The person in front of you is also recessed with their head sticking into your space. Air Berlin's plastic seat divider is - inexplicably - cut low in the back with the effect of exposing the top of your head if lower your back rest. If you recline and the person ""behind you"" (remember they're only half-way recessed) doesn't they're breathing on your scalp. If the person behind you coughs a lot - as happened to me - you're either coughed on the head a lot or you simply can't recline. This is exactly the kind of annoyance one pays to avoid in business class. In addition to significantly reduced width the seats are very short. I'm 185cms (6'1"") and I could only ""lie down"" with my knees pulled up toward my chest. On my right the armrest was about four inches thick. On my left it was exactly the width of my index finger (not an exaggeration) and it was squeaky and wobbly (hard to believe but true). The in-flight entertainment is good with a solid noise-cancelling headset provided. The 15"" screen is decent and operated via a remote with a mouse-like controller that works reasonably well but which your mother will not learn to use in a 100 years. The entertainment selection is limited. There were a few new movies but most of the selection was old stuff. There is a power outlet and a USB outlet. Storage is a problem. There is a compartment with cheap carpeting under the ottoman a pouch for magazines and rather small overhead compartments. Except for the medium-sized table there are no surfaces. Every business class passenger has - a few inches from their face - a strange UFO-looking contraption that turns out to be a combination of reading light and ""night light."" One can't help thinking this must be a case of designers gone insane. These units are unnecessary because there already is a reading light in the ceiling and ugly and cheap-looking producing the palest ""night light"" you could imagine. The food is pretty bad. Decent alcoholic beverages and snacks are available at any time. The flight attendants try pretty hard but they can't make up for the failings and cheapness of the cabin. They're nice but they'll throw you out of the kitchen immediately if you try to get up and stretch your legs a little. This shouldn't even be called ""business class."" It's more of a glorified economy class plus."	0
Just returned home from Lanzarote to Belfast on Saturday 25th August and was shocked about the level of customer care given. The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.	0
Booked a flight from DUB to YYC 8 months in advance. While I was on vacation Aer Lingus emailed me 6 times to notify me that our connection from ORD to YYC was cancelled but they failed to provide any assistance to get us home. I called their customer service line who offered me a similar flight on a different day but were unable to accommodate our schedule. I asked for a refund for the ORD to YYC portion of the flight which they agreed to but the agent was not able to tell me how much that refund would be. I had to rebook ORD to YYC on my own with a different airline. I will never use Aer Lingus again and I don't recommend it to anyone. Very poor customer service.	0
Istanbul to Sharm El Sheikh and Cairo to Istanbul: The planes were new clean Airbus 320. They didn't serve us a hot meal only refreshments (butter cookies and a drink). Even the flights have been delayed for 2 hours on both ways I recommend Air Cairo.	0
Brussels to Luxor. Good charter airline. Modern A320 aircraft with friendly fa's. No entertainment onboard but hot meal served.	0
Moscow to Vladivostok. The worst flight I ever had  chose economy as biz class is a rip off for domestic flight - service is terrible. I called many time the hostess for a glass of water during the night - no one came. No need to talk about food it was terrible. Service is like the food. My last experience with this airline (beside the one hour flight to St Petersburg I do regularly) I don't understand how they can be SkyTeam member.	0
Beijing- Moscow. The customer service is appalling! Unfriendly unhelpful and rude staff! Tried to call service helpdesk in Moscow and no one would answer the phone or speak sufficient English. They have a long way to go to improve customer experience.	0
"Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Most uncomfortable seat and with the smallest leg room I've ever experienced. Knees where wedged against the seat in front of me the entire flight and I'm only 5'11"". They had to have the guy in front of me put his seat forward when serving the meals just to fit the food trays in. Entertainment and movie selection was laughable with nothing even remotely current. I know this is a low cost carrier but Ryanair is more comfortable that Air Berlin. Spend a few extra dirham and go with any other carrier than Air Berlin."	0
Flyer beware! I recently booked a flight through OneWorld Alliance-American Airlines. I received the confirmation email stating clearly a 2 baggage allowance. I arrived to the airport with an extra bag which I was prepared to pay for. The check in desk refused to acknowledge the baggage allowance in the confirmation email and preceded to charge my card for all the bags. The card was swiped several times as the agent said the charge would not go through. At this point I opted not to take the flight due to the excessive cost (550 Euro) and left with all my bags. I checked my account today only to discover that $412 USD has been taken from my account from AirBerlin. As I did not approve these charges I do not have a receipt. I attempted to call AirBerlin but was not able to get a human being on the phone.	0
Flown them on several occasions and every time there seems to be some sort of problem. The most recent - I was flying to Dublin (with Iberia and British Airways) from Central America via Madrid and London. My flight from Madrid to London (on BA) was delayed so I went to Iberia and said I had to get another flight from London. They immediately changed my flight and put me on the earliest flight possible so that I could make my flight free of charge. I arrived in London and made my way as quick as I could to Aer Lingus. I was too late for my bags to go through but there was one more flight. I could change onto that flight for €78. I booked an overpriced €250 round trip from Dublin to London and then missed a flight due to another delayed flight and they wanted to charge me more to take an empty seat on the next flight! The staff member in London was rude with an uncaring attitude. No level of hospitality and kindness. Flight itself was fine - no frills not much better than Ryanair not much worse.	0
Tuesday 24th July from Manchester - Waterford. Checked in on time for a departure at 13.15 this actually took off at 16.30 for Cork! If somebody had explained that the plane was being diverted to Cork and we were then being bussed back to Waterford we would have made alternative arrangements. When we were given our £3 lunch voucher we were told that our flight was in Cork. No mention that our flight was being diverted to Cork as well. When we arrived at Cork there was nobody to guide us to the baggage it was not labelled we eventually found the bus! At no time were we told what was happening total lack of communication.	0
"Recently traveled for family vacation from JFK-DUB-NAP. Our original flights to Italy experienced minor delays but our return trip from Naples Italy was horrendous. We were delayed multiple times with no explanation. No Aer Lingus employee ever came to the Gate to explain what was going on. We were not offered the opportunity to fly on another airline and by the time we departed we missed our connection in Dublin and were forced to stay overnight in Dublin causing me to miss a critical business meeting. Additionally staff in Dublin ""accidentally"" booked us on flights (through London Heathrow) with another overnight layover. I did not discover this until we were in out hotel room in Dublin purely by accident because we were not issued tickets just handed a computer printout and told we were on flights to JFK in the morning. That night after discovering the error I found a United flight direct to Newark NJ and asked to be booked on that instead which I was ""allowed"" to do. This was the first time I encountered someone helpful at Aer Lingus. Now rebooked on a direct flight the next morning to Newark NJ at my request. To compound the experience the flight from Dublin was delayed 2 hours."	0
My first experience with Aeroflot has been really awful. December 26th Moscow Sheremetyevo to Beijing but due to the bad weather many flights including mine are cancelled. Aeroflot is unable to cope with the passengers requests for clarification and the assistant who manages the Transit office is only able to say that she cannot tell anything to anybody and that passengers should just hear the announcements and watch the displays. Needless to say the announcements are barely audible and spoken in a language which hardly resembles English and the displays report incorrect information. We happen to discover by chance that Aeroflot dispenses meal vouchers which passengers are able to receive only after long and exhausting queues. The worst part is when the flight Moscow-Beijing is actually announced at 1630 on December 27th. No information is given as to who is allowed to access the airplane and this causes chaos at the gate. After some time rumors spread that only passengers with a ticket for Dec 27th flight will be admitted as well as some people with the ticket for the Dec 26th flight. After a couple of hours in wait at the gate an announcement of an Air China flight to Beijing has the result to disperse part of the crowd mostly Chinese but when we go to the gate joining the others we notice that the monitor at the gate reports a flight to Antalya. Therefore we go back to the Moscow-Beijing gate and after pushing and shoving we are admitted into the airplane with no apparent logic while other passengers are left behind. What has happened is really beyond comprehension and I discourage anyone from flying Aeroflot which is the worst company that I have used in my entire life.	0
Flew Air Berlin last night (26/04/14) from Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Extremely limited service left my food and very uncomfortable flight. These are literally a low cost airline with a poor meal and a bottle of water thrown in. If Etihad endorse these then we'll revert back to Emirates.	0
We had a terrible experience with how our cancelled flight was handled and the subsequent customer service after the flight on June 22nd out of New York (JFK) to Shannon. After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.	0
I expected to fly from Moscow to Stockholm on December 26 2010 but the flight was first delayed several times and then cancelled. As a result I reached Stockholm on December 28 - after waiting in Sheremetyevo for more than 2 days and nights without any information food or lodging. The electronic screens displayed misleading information about many flights that were delayed or cancelled. I found out that my flight was about to depart merely by chance from my fellow travellers. After registration it was impossible to find any representative of Aeroflot in the international terminal D - they were just afraid to get out to the angry crowd and when they finally ventured they could not answer any questions and would not give their supervisors names. The new beautiful terminal is a mess without those who are responsible for customer service. I felt trapped and betrayed.	0
Bangkok-Moscow-Prague and return. I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever. Thanks for the flight but I guess Ill give someone else my business until I see a considerable move forward from Aeroflot.	0
Flight from Dublin to Heathrow to get connecting flight with Air New Zealand to LAX. Flight delayed followed by chaotic approach in prioritising passengers meant we missed our connection by 5 minutes. This would have been avoidable if cabin crew had adhered to its policy of getting connecting flight passengers off first via rear door. Instead we were the last to leave as front door took priority. Very disappointing.	0
This a totally no frills airline with seats so close together that there is no room for your knees and if the person in front of you decides to recline your poor knees will pay a price. Getting in and out of seats is difficult and seats are very thin. Our flight was MIA-DUS and too long for comfort this carrier is best suited for regional routes not trans-Atlantic routes that become gruelling. I would rather pay 10% more to get additional leg space from a more traditional carrier. Crew was nice but had a reluctance to speak English even though they are serving an American market I thought that was strange as they clearly could speak English. Food was normal airline fare with lunch and a light breakfast. We flew the A330 which was very nice and new. Our DUS- Berlin and Berlin-Rome flights were fine both on A320's.	0
We have today flown back from Cork airport on flight EI3701 to Birmingham. There were four of us so I pre-booked seats on Row 3 to ensure that we sat together. Unfortunately the legroom in these seats was much narrower than the rest of the seats. The two male passengers were 6ft 4in and 6ft 2in so you can imagine the uncomfortable journey they had to endure. It would have been preferable not to book seats in advance and take pot luck!	0
Shocking late service which the airline knew was running late but instead decided to leave everyone at Gatwick staring at the departure board for half an hour with the - please wait sign on. Unloading and loading of passengers was painfully slow (some passengers haven't yet grasped the need to read the ticket and establish what seat they are in). This is the second time this flight has been delayed and the excuses are somewhat similar. It might be an idea to cut the number of flights if they cannot keep the ones to London Gatwick on time. Very Poor prefer Ryanair. The 15/6/2012 Gatwick to Dublin.	0
Flew to Milan via Dublin from JFK on June 5th. Found check-in staff at JFK to be extremely rude and not helpful. Aircraft was clean and departure was on time. Toilet midway through flight had no toilet paper or paper towels. They did nothing and appeared to have cared less.	0
STN-DUS-TXL. After I read lots of negative feedback about Air Berlin over here I was a bit terrified to use this airline. Actually my both flights were just fine and I can't say nothing bad. It's just 3 star airline so expect 3 star service. Cabin crew not smiling that's true. I read that on intercontinental flights lots of tall pax struggle I was just fine and picked an aisle seat as precaution. Seat comfort - just normal. Flights were departing little late but arriving on time. Check in luggage arrived with me into destination. The small plane this airline is using on route from London are extremely loud.	0
My reservation was for LAX to Dusseldorf to Salzburg. After I made my reservations I got 6 changes from Air Berlin. I paid for the XL seats (more leg room) from LAX to Dusseldorf. After all their changes I am now traveling from LAX to JFK to Dusseldorf to Salzburg and they gave me XL seats only from JFK to Dusseldorf and I now have a 12-hour layover in Dusseldorf. They have rude clerks on the phone. No one can make a decision without a manager and managers only work 8-5 European time.	0
I flew to and from Abu Dhabi to Norway and return. I was very disappointed in both the seat comfort quality of food and general service. The seats were narrow with poor leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the short flight from Oslo to Berlin than the long flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi and they were hard and generally uncomfortable. The food on the way over was unrecognizable let alone edible with a business class passenger asking me what is was while we were awaiting customs clearance so they obviously got the same thing. The return flight food was marginally better. The staff were friendly and polite but did little to help a woman who had a 4 month old baby and a toddler who had booked a seat with a crib and didn't get it. She was basically told 'bad luck' and they left her to ask 2 other passengers if she could swap seats with them to accommodate her sitting with her child in the crib which attached to the wall. The toilets were also in a revolting state by the time we arrived at both destinations because they were not cleaned at all. I will not use this airline again. I had expected better from an affiliate of Etihad airlines who are excellent.	0
"I am only 5'3"" tall a frequent traveller and have never had any issues with legroom. Flew Budapest to Chicago round trip in economy class and was shocked at how cramped it was. If the person in front of you reclines their seat at all it is impossible to even move in your chair. The monitor was literally just a few inches from my face. I have never felt so claustrophobic on a flight before. Flight attendants do their job but with a bit of attitude. Also I had one piece of extra luggage (not overweight) on the return flight and I was charged $200 USD. Their fees are written very clearly on a piece of paper when you arrive at the airport but are very unclear and confusing on their website. Considering most airlines charge anywhere from $50-70 for an extra piece of luggage $200 is beyond ridiculous."	0
London to Toronto. Flight delayed 5 hrs and no explanation or food vouchers were given. When it came for boarding, ground staff were shouting at passengers. Flight was very old B767, Air Canada should stop sending these old 767's across Atlantic, entertainment system did not work for the whole flight, crew tried to reset it but it did not fix the issue, it was a very long flight to have no entertainment system. When it came to food, it was awful.	0
"We paid extra for seats with leg room from Chicago to Berlin and on to Salzburg. We did get the leg room seats. However it seems that Air Berlin seats are exceptionally narrow. I did not measure the seat but my guess is that even an inch or two makes a great deal of difference. As we were taxiing in (both directions) the air conditioner condensation came dripping down onto my legs. On the way to Berlin this was a significant amount of water less so on the way back. The flight attendants who were sitting facing us and just smiled and said ""condensation"". While on the plane after I read for a while I attempted to turn off the overhead light. It would not go off. The flight attendant said that it had to be turned off by the computer which for the life of me I could got get into place. After he helped he could not get the computer to turn off the light. He switched computers and that still didn't work. We asked if we could change seats but there were not leg room seats available. The flight attendants tried to be very helpful. Berlin Tegel is a grey stone cold airport. Cigarette butts all over the place. Even people who were cleaning just bumped into you with the mop without a word of ""excuse me"" like the whole row of waiting passengers was supposed to get out of our seats while she mopped. I would not recommend Air Berlin."	0
I will never fly Air Berlin again! Some of my flights were ok but flying Dusseldorf to JFK business class was terrible. The seats seemed like they were from 1966 - very old and extremely uncomfortable. Fly this airline at your own risk.	0
We had a confirmed booking to fly from Toronto to Newark on 27 Jul 2015 by AC 768. At the time of checking in, we were shocked when they said that we were on stand by when the tickets were booked over 4 months ago. The seats were not allotted until we reached the gate, which meant we were not scheduled to fly on that plane. Unacceptable! They started serving snacks and drinks just 30 mins before landing and they only served a few rows, not all. Reason being it was time to land. So, the cabin crew did not know how long they will take to serve all passengers? Why did they even start serving? Air Canada dropped lowest in our rating considering the amount of international travel we do every year.	0
I travelled 27th July from Toronto to LHR. This was quite possibly the worst experience I have had with an airline. The plane was delayed but the main issue I had was the state of the 767-300 aircraft. The entertainment system was not working, seats were in a poor condition, WC's were in a poor state and the experience was somewhat disappointing, particularly as I paid almost £800 for the flight. I would probably not consider flying with Air Canada again based on the experience I had.	0
I have not used Aer Lingus for many years because of cost. I recently went from Dublin to New York. Outward journey perfect. Return another matter. I could not book a seat and at JFK I was the very first in line I was handed a boarding card not having been asked if I would like an aisle seat or otherwise. I did ask for the same seat I had on the outward journey if it was available. I was told it was not and handed the boarding card within 10 seconds. The impression I I got was that the lady at the desk did not even look. It will be a while before I use Aer Lingus again.	0
Indifferent cabin crew acted like passengers were an inconvenience. No choice of meal, only pasta in a white sauce and this was an international flight. I have flown Air Canada several times and have no idea how they get a 4 star rating I have flown other four star airlines such as Lufthansa and Etihad and I can say Air Canada does not belong in the same category.	0
Our flight was a 10 hour and 43 minute flight from Calgary to Tokyo however during the flight we were not able to access the entertainment system as it was broken. We went up to the service desk to ask if there was anything that was available that we could use instead of the entertainment system on board but understandably last minute there was nothing. The service we recieved at the ground desk was terrible. We were not treated with much respect almost as if we, the customers were something that was not important. After our disappointing encounter with the ground staff we got on board. We found out that our light and attendant call button were both broken. We got complaint forms however when we tried to enter them online all three cards had invalid claim numbers and therefore we cant claim anything. I have tried to call the airline from Japan but there is no free call to the airline therefor after not having entertainment we have recieved no assistance. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.	0
The first leg of travel was from Istanbul to London on Turkish Airlines - amazing service, customer service and comfort. The second leg from LHR to YYC on good old Air Canada was a nightmare. Boarded on time, sat on tarmac for an hour with no communication and forbidden use of bathrooms. Food during flight was mediocre to poor. Service was terrible, seemed like the staff was being forced to work there, seating was less comfortable than the Turkish Airlines used during first shorter sector.	0
Flight from CPH-TXL. As this is a short flight (around 60 minutes everything included) food and beverages are not a matter of survival. However Air Berlin was once renowned for its on board service even on short haul routes. No longer. There was absolutely no service at all on this flight. Neither was there any explanation. One flight attendant privately admitted that they did not have anything on board. Too bad as they were one such a great airline.	0
Came off a flight from London and had booked an internal flight to get me to Edmonton. Turns out it would have been quicker to drive. We boarded on time but were then told that there was an electrical fault with one of the radios. We waited on the tarmac for an hour and then an engineer came and replaced the offending part. During this time, communication from the flight attendant was scant and when he did speak it was comical. Each time he read the announcements from his dog-eared handbook looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world from here. We eventually took off and the flight to Edmonton was fine. On landing we were in the middle of a thunderstorm so there was no tractor available to tow us to the gate. We waited around 30 mins and then we were good to go. Coming back it was another story. I was booked on the 3pm flight back to Calgary to connect to AC850 at 17.50. I checked in and was happily waiting at the gate when my cousin called to tell me we were delayed (she was getting updates from an app on her phone). There was nothing to say we were delayed on any of the airport screens. Further updates came through to say the delay was being extended and then it finally came up at the gate, although no announcements were made. I had to watch the 4pm and 5pm flights depart on time and then finally the 3pm flight was cancelled and we were transferred to the 6pm flight. Obviously I had missed my connection by that point. Cabin staff on the return leg were rude and unhelpful when I tried to enquire how best to get to my next gate at Calgary. I understand that airlines are always prone to delays but the lack of communication really annoyed me. I'll definitely try to get a direct flight next time. Flight attendants could definitely benefit from some customer service training	0
"On the way from Toronto to Beijing we were told that there was no hot water beverages due to ""contamination issues."" The flight staff were not very friendly. On the way home we were forced to downgrade my ticket from first class to coach because my children were in coach and it was against policy. My husband and I sat in the last row of first class and my kids were in the first row of coach. The first class row was literally right in front of the row my children sat in. There were absolutely no issues on our leg out to China with my kids sitting in coach. I was never told that this was against policy. On our way back the ticketing agent refused to issue our tickets. We tried upgrading the kids that was refused because on the second leg of the trip there were no first class seats available. However, on the second leg of the trip there were only economy seats on the flight. The desk agent made us wait for over an hour refusing to give me back my passports. They said the only way we could fly is if they downgraded my ticket for an economy class seat. The agent refused to allow me to keep my first class seat. The whole situation was beyond logic."	0
No Transit At Tegel airport and double security check at arrival and departure! One hour transit is not enough and we almost didn't make to the flight! From TLV to Tegel and from Tegel to Zurich. Our luggage didn't arrive and we had to wait 3 hours for the next Air Berlin flight to receive our luggage! Cheap but not worth it!	0
Worst experience with Air Berlin was my first and will be my last. Flying from TXL to GDN and the flight was cancelled at the last minute no extra information was given and the boarding screen was just switched off so no one knew what was going on. Then we had to stand in a line for over 2 hours to be told that there were no flights for a few days after which was unacceptable. Then it was the whole process of finding the luggage to collect and the staff were so rude and unhelpful.	0
For the 4th time in 4 weeks I have been delayed on the Edinburgh - Shannon route which is operated by Aer Arann. In all cases this was blamed on technical difficulties with the aircraft - ageing ATR72 turbo props. Today I had a 3hr delay out of Shannon and the Manchester flight was delayed 6 hrs. Very little information and the Aer Lingus information desk was unstaffed most of the time.	0
Sitting in the rear area of the cabin, did not receive a drink. Cabin crew could not get to us on time, they were stressed to get service done. Disappointed in the service. Only three cabin crew for a full flight.	0
Our flight from San Francisco to Dusseldorf was delayed 27 hours. We were promised a hotel for the night in the SF area. Instead Air Berlin provided us with no accommodation no advice no refreshments no phone calls. We were misinformed by Air Berlin about the availability of hotels in SF and alternative flights across the Atlantic. In effect we were abandoned by Air Berlin. We therefore cancelled the flight and flew with another airline. We would not recommend Air Berlin.	0
"JFK-Berlin-Sofia-Stansted-Dusseldorf-JFK. Planes are new and clean but the space between seats is really small. I am 5'7"" and found it to be tight can't imagine how someone taller will feel. At one point the person behind me asked me to move my backrest forward because it was too tight for them. Food is average to below average maybe at par with American's food on international trips but lesser quality than British Airways. Flight was on time service was decent. I have a OneWorld Sapphire status so I used the BA lounge in Berlin (TXL). The lounge was old and quite dirty kind of like the airport itself. Selection of food was poor drinks were ok. On return flight I was not able to use a lounge at the Stansted airport - AirBerlin pointed me to a lounge but when I got there the attendant told me that AB does not have a contract with them. Then there was a last minute gate change and I had to sprint to a new gate to catch my flight. Used AirBerlin lounge in Dusseldorf - minimal selection of food ok on drinks. Flight from Dusseldorf to JFK was on time with 2 meal services average quality of meals. I do not plan to fly AirBerlin in the future."	0
I am a Canadian who lives and works in South America. I have made the trip from Ecuador to Canada three times this year. Each time I traveled, my baggage as been misplaced and delayed (three times in a row, consecutively). Their staff in Pearson (Toronto) are not informed on baggage through customs. I was given three different answers by three different employees. Air Canada has a policy where you do not directly speak to employees regarding complaints. Rather, you write in an e-mail complaint and are told you'll get a response withing 25 days to a month. AC's lost articles policy is time consuming, requires paper mail and has a lengthy window period for response. This is not worth the hassle in many cases.	0
"Departure from Montreal scheduled at 20.00 delayed at registration for 22.30. Midnight at embarking door, flight was cancelled without any kind of explanation, no option on another flight. We were asked to pick up our luggage, we were given a phone number but no human assistance, no voucher, no advice. The only hotel we could find at 1.00 am was the Marriott). We are elderly women foreigners without contact in Montreal. Next morning we learn by email (assuming you can read your mail abroad) that a plane will board at 17.00- no apology and no explanation. Arrival in Geneva with 20 hour delay. No assistance from Air Canada, nobody to help and direct us to a so called ""reasonable hotel""."	0
BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.	0
Use Aer Lingus for European flights about 5 times a year. We have found that over the last year or two their planes are filthy the seats food-trays and seat-pockets are sticky and dirty every time we travel. We have always used Aer Lingus when possible and have found the service pricing and onboard staff to be excellent but the poor cleanliness is really letting them down. I can't understand why they are letting this area slip so badly.	0
Flew to Lisbon from Toronto July 27 2015, plane was a older model, no entertainment system. We had to download an app on the iPad or if you don't have a iPad the airline rents them for $10. Movies are mostly older ones, which I was shocked to see, since I've flown overseas many times. The leg room seems tight compared to other overseas flights I've taken. Crew were very nice. I'm Canadian, and very disappointed in my countries main airliner. Long ways to go to be a premium airline.	0
I was disappointed by my travel day with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto connecting in Toronto to Dublin. The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off. We landed in Toronto and almost ran off the plane to try to make what I thought would be a very short connection of about 30 minutes in a huge airport. Turns out the next leg was also delayed, so far by 2 hours (I'm still sitting her, waiting to board and fuming) for, again, maintenance. Apparently this time they know what's wrong but they have to go get a part to replace something in one of the pilot/copilots chairs? At least that's what I gleaned from the flight attendants and various other passengers discussing the issue. I understand that delays happen sometimes. But its a little ridiculous for both of these planes to need last minute maintenance. We haven't been offered any kind of compensation for all of this trouble and I'm annoyed. I've flown air Canada before and had things go as expected but only once before and a 50/50 record isn't great.	0
I was travelling from Edmonton, CA to Cairo, Egypt on Monday July 6th 2015 on flight AC 8153, with my 17 and 15 years old children and my 7 month old baby. We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever. We were just given vouchers and told that was all they could do for us. Finally when we got to our final destination, adding to all the hassle we faced, our luggage had not been put on our flight and we had to wait for almost 48 hours before we got them.	0
We are a family of 5 who had booked a flight from Montreal to Athens with Aegean Airlines on July 26, 2015. It turned out it was Air Canada Rouge, flight AC 1902. The experience was mostly poor. The airplane was a 767-300 with tight legroom and no entertainment monitor displays. This was a big surprise for a transatlantic flight. When I did the web check-in on aircanada.com, it showed that the airplane had individual displays. The crew said you could download the application on an android or apple smartphone or rent an Ipad for $10. Of course we do not have such a device for each member of the family and paying for such a basic service item was out of the question. The Wifi was slow and the entertainment server would show busy many times when we tried to connect with the smartphone. The food was below average but the washrooms were kept in good condition during the flight. The only positive was the crew. They did all they could to help with questions and queries. I am not impressed with Air Canada Rouge. The quality of service is much lower than with Air Transat which we used to travel to Spain, Portugal, and France.	0
I flew to Europe on June 15 from Fort Myers (FL) to Duesseldorf. My previous trip was in January 2013 (Berlin- Miami). Company changed their fees on June 1st and nobody had a courtesy to let me know that even though I am their top bonus member (frequent flyer program). I called before my flight to double check and asked if there is anything else I should be aware of (I flew with them few times before so I was familiar with their policies) and teller forgot to mention they changed baggage fees (from 50Euros to 200$). Customer service representative at the check in desk forgot to mention that too and she just transferred me to the cashier and it was than when I found out about the charge! I don't mind paying but I do mind being ripped off! Besides that their seats are very small and food quality could be better (a lot better).	0
"I checked our family of 6 in online before we departed YVR. For some reason, I was not able to complete this for my sister. Once we arrived at YVR, the agent could not explain why there was a problem. Departure was on time. Leg room was non-existent, and I'm only 5'2"" tall! Seats cushion reminded me of those foamies we used to sit on in 1978 for a football game. Seat only reclined 1.5"" for an red-eye flight. Only purchased a chocolate bar for $3.50 so no idea of food quality. Only 2 drink services on a 6 hour flight seemed a little poor (and hot drinks were not available one way). IFE was non-accessible because we weren't told about the app until 3 minutes before we had to turn off our phones - no time to download. On the way home I has this handled only to discover the movies were tremendously old! Attendant who spoke in eng/fr over the PA system spoke so poorly, it reminded me of a Charlie Brown episode. I'm all for low-brow discount air travel, but I expected better of AC. I might as well have flown with Allegiant. In that case, I know what I'll find (and do to Vegas regularly). So poor value for $. For the same amount, I could fly with Hawaiian out of Seatac and receive full service and leg room."	0
At Dusseldorf airport now waiting for a flight to Milan Malpensa. Our flight was about to board at 4.45pm they started boarding when all of a sudden we were told the flight was cancelled and with no further instruction or explanation other than to go get our bags and get our tickets re-issued. The Air Berlin staff are rude unhelpful and did not give us any alternatives other than to cancel flights or get on an even later flight out of Dusseldorf. This was my first experience with Air Berlin and it will be my last.	0
Fine going to Vancouver, but on return there was a big delay! After 3 hours they changed the gate and got another plane - so an almost 4 hour delay.	0
Flying AC1753 from Varadero to Toronto (connected fly) July 22 2015. Asked for a glass of water 15 minutes after taking off. It was brought 1.5 hours later, the water was not drinkable. I couldn't drink it, I gave it back to an air hostess and asked for a good one, she said yes, the water she gave me was the tap water because Air Canada Rouge do not offer bottle water to passengers, however she said she would give me a glass of bottled water as an exception.	0
Toronto to Vancouver and back. Outbound I had a broken USB in first seat outbound, then broken headphone jack on second. 2 meter trim strip falling off and into aisle. Climate control failure onboard had passengers sweating profusely. Return flight, suddenly my carryon, which had flow with me all over Canada for 3.5 weeks (I was covering the Women's World Cup) is too large or too heavy, though it is max carry on size on other airlines I've flown. Wouldn't let us board. After 30 minutes and showing them the photographic gear they wanted me to put below (they would not guarantee it's safety,) they finally accepted my idea to put my camera bag in the crew area. Onboard, they ran out of food. Flight attendants left our consumed flood on our trays for 1.5 hours. When I rang call button to ask them to pick up the tray, I was chastised and told to set it on the floor. The attendant who came to me couldn't take it away, she told to me to set it on the floor in the exit row.	0
"Business class from LAX to Berlin as LH had a technical so they offered this: Great One World Lounge in LAX far better in every way than the place that LH shares. New plane. Crew interested and friendly. Business seats were a trip back in time - far from flat and also cheap-uncomfortable so very stupid when they compete with flat beds on the route. Food was about OK only but no ""class"". Overall: was nothing like a Business should be at the price."	0
Air Berlin carries its passengers in very low regard. After several plane issues a problem with the door opening and other mechanical problems we sat on the plane at the gate for 30 minutes. While most of the plane had connecting flights the airline did not hold the planes. After flying 11 hours from LAX to Berlin I counted twelve of us that missed the connecting flight to Zurich due to the airline's failures. Had they held the plane it could not have been delayed more than ten minutes. So I had to wait five hours in the Berlin airport for the next flight. The airline's response? A measly $10 voucher not accepted by many businesses in the airport.	0
It was a 12 hour flight from Vancouver to Osaka but there was no screen for any entertainment. With a family of five with three kids under 12, this was terrible. There was an app we could download to watch movies but the selection was minimal and we did not prepare enough devices for the trip because we assumed there would be provided screens. Also, nowhere to charge your device! How do they expect us to use our own device and not charge it? Half way through the flight all the battery was gone and we were a very grumpy family. Also the plane was very old and trashy.	0
I would not recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. To start my trip I signed up for notification for cancelled or delayed flight. I got nothing but find myself sitting at the airport with a 3 hour delay. No problem, delays happen. When we were getting ready to finally board they were over booked and had to sort out that issue. I booked an early flight so I would have an extra day in Vegas. That was blown. Flight home surprise agian delay. Smaller this time but still delayed. Now when we finally land we have been at the airport for 20 min but are still sitting on the plane because there is no room for us to park. I am currently still on the run tarmac sitting in a very hot plane. This is my first and last flight with Air Canada Rouge.	0
Canadian Customs and very slow baggage pickup caused delay in getting to the check-in counter to transfer baggage. Waited 45 minutes to get through customs, baggage was another 20 minutes before they got it on the carousel. When we got to the counter, the agent refused to issue boarding passes because she said we would not make the flight - we had 50 minutes before departure. The transfer baggage counter had actually closed 20 minutes before we arrived. We were forced to spend the night in Toronto. Toronto Airport is a terribly disorganized Airport and Air Canada fell very short of what I have known them to be. They charged for extra baggage even though they participate in a codeshare. They also took advantage of inexperienced travelers by checking in two people booked on one ticket so they could double the extra baggage charge. I personally will no longer make Air Canada a consideration for any flights in the future.	0
Berlin to Abu Dhabi and back. In general aircraft's ok but the biggest problem in the company is the impolite and unhelpful staff. Flight attendants do not offer help or service at all. Atmosphere in the plane was not very comfortable due to rudeness of cabin crew. We try to avoid flying with Air Berlin from now on.	0
Worse than Air Transat. Terrible price-quality. Food disgusting. No individual screens or audio system. Must rent a tablet which is a cheap money grab. To be avoided at all costs.	0
Air Canada Rouge by far the worst airline I have been on, the prices you pay for a ticket and the level of comfort is unacceptable. Their business class is as good as United Airlines economy. Plus if you are 5'10 or taller you can barely fit in the seats and zero leg room.	0
Upon arriving at Dublin Airport at 9am we were told our flight was delayed 12 hours. Keep in mind the weather was sunny and beautiful. No explanation given, just some crummy food vouchers for $25 to be used in the airport. Our connection to Chicago was going to be missed, so Air Canada said they would put us in a hotel at their expense, once we arrived in Toronto. At 9pm we boarded the plane only to be held on the runway for another 2 hours. Once again, no explanation. A long flight to Toronto then commenced. Upon landing in Toronto we were then told that they would not honor the hotel, but that we could sleep on the cold concrete floor in the airport until our Chicago connection was ready to board.	0
Upon arrival at the airport, we paid $75 for 3 pieces of checked luggage and went to the bag drop only to be told we didn't have seats as the flight was full. If someone has paid for a seat on a plane, they should have that seat. After a few minutes of arguing, he assured us that we would be on the flight. When we had gone through security, we went to the customer service desk and explained what had happened. The lady there told us we did not have seats at this stage and that the guy in baggage drop had no authority to guarantee that we would get on the plane. She told us to wait at the gate to see if we were allocated a seat. After a very tense hour, and after most of the passengers had boarded, we were eventually called to the gate and given boarding passes, seated several rows apart. Compared to other airlines around the world, and particularly our domestic flights on Qantas and Virgin Australia, the standard of service is well below par. Having to pay for checked in luggage on top of an inflated flight price, and only offered a soft drink or juice and small pack of nuts adds insult to injury. They made the end to our lovely 6 week holiday in Canada a stressful time unnecessarily.	0
WSW-TLX. Flight delayed by 2hrs. No sms or email sent to inform passengers. Rude check in staff. No apology given onboard. Ageing noisy turboprop plane. Unpleasant experience.	0
Glasgow-JFK via Dublin. All flights on time and clearing US customs and border protection in Dublin was an unexpected bonus. The seats and inflight entertainment was above average. However the bar service was only offered once during a 7.5 hour flight. I asked the stewardess if the drinks trolley would be making another appearance or if I could purchase a beer and she told me I could just have tea or coffee.	0
Just spent half a day booking a simple flight from Cardiff to Dublin. The on line booking seemed simple until I tried to add and pay the £24 extra for a checked piece of luggage. What a joke and a waste of my time. The call centre operator eventually sorted my problem out but I have been left with a very negative view of 'Cheepo' airlines. The system is misleading since I did not realise there was extra to pay until after the booking was made. All pretty rubbish really. Let's hope the flight is not as poor.	0
Tired B777-300ER. Most B773s are sparkling new, this must have been one of the originals. Crew was delightful, food was average. Would consider Air Canada slightly better than US-based airlines but not world class by any means.	0
"JFK to Nice via DUS. Flight was awful. The whole flight was spent with a woman putting her seat back in my lap. Mind you the legroom was barely existent to begin with. The seat back TV had no sound and the one on my wife's side had no picture. The crew while strolling by didn't really react to anything. The food? The ""meal"" on this flight was inedible! I could barely wait for them to take it away! The only saving grace was the warm beers I could occasionally get from a bored crew member. The second leg was thankfully quick and over fast no food and they wanted money for everything. Sometimes comfort is worth the price."	0
JFK-CTA with a connection in Berlin. Plane delayed 3 hours for no reason out of JFK. Missed connecting flight to Catania. Air Berlin re-routed us through Rome and then by Meridiana to Catania. The entire time telling us our bags would arrive when we do. No problem. We land in Catania. Our bags never made it. Finally got our bags the night we were leaving. The airline is very disorganized. The seats and leg space are small. The food is terrible.	0
Air Berlin flights out of Dusseldorf delayed all week per lounge receptionist. Ours delayed 2.5 hours which puts our connection in serious jeopardy in the US. The lounge is small and the food the most limited I have seen since flying business and first (maybe 10 years). I asked if some other food (sandwiches etc) could be provided since we were missing lunch and attendants said this is all they ever have. After reading other reviews regarding seats and service in Business I will not let American Airlines lead me this way again.	0
I booked our vacation package specifically because the flight attached to the Gran Bahia was flying with Air Canada and I expected to be impressed with this airline. Unfortunately, everything on Air Canada’s end was abysmal. Our flight (AC-1812), scheduled to depart from Toronto at 4.35pm was delayed five hours thus we arrived at our hotel at 5.30am and lost a huge part of the first day on our trip. We heard that the plane had mechanical problems in Cancun and was thus delayed. We were given ten-dollar vouchers for food at the airport and as a result, were not even offered snacks on the flight. Had this been the end of our poor experience with Air Canada, it would not have been a huge deal, however, our flight home (AC-1813), scheduled for 9.50pm on February 28th was cancelled completely. After our return flight was initially delayed, they had to cancel our flight to Toronto because they were missing a part for the navigation system in their plane. After both mechanical failures and massive delays, we did not feel confident that our flight would depart on time. Our flight was supposed to depart at 9.50pm on Saturday 28th of February but instead they booked a new flight at 5pm the next day. In the end, we had to book a flight home with WestJet. There was no one in the airport who could explain our options to us or help us get home on time. It would have been nice to have had some one with answers, as we were given none. We were herded back through customs for a couple of hours and when we finally got out of the airport, I still had the courtesy to tell one of them that we would not be leaving on the flight or staying at the hotel.	0
Vancouver to Toronto. Checked in 2 pieces of luggage at 25.00/piece. I don't mind the user fee but the carry on luggage was extreme. The flight was full. Carry on's excessive and large. The option to have carry on's stowed while waiting at the gate was unfair to those who had to pay to stow luggage. It was obvious that most of the carry on did not meet the regulations. Way too much luggage brought onto cabin. Very time consuming waiting for people to find a place to store luggage. The flight was uncomfortable. Seats are not large enough for most people to sit comfortably. Nothing complimentary offered other than water, other food and beverages to purchase. On a 5 hour flight I think free juice/coffee should be offered.	0
Flight was delayed at time of boarding for 45 minutes of maintenance. Was delayed leaving the gate for half an hour because no available ground crew. Once in Montreal, baggage delivery took forty-five minutes. Two later arriving planes got their luggage first. What should have been a one hour forty five minute trip ended up taking four hours.	0
"New York - Dusseldorf - Venice return Vienna - Dusseldorf - New York. The smallest space between rows I have experienced. Anyone over 5ft 8"" will be miserable. Airport staff at Dusseldorf offered no updates on delayed return flight - verbal rebellion at the gate. Never again."	0
Business Class JFK-Berlin then on to Krakow 3 days later and then to Budapest 3 days later. In that time they managed to lose our luggage twice. In Berlin there is no one in the baggage area to help you. Lost luggage is handled by a separate outfit located in Terminal C Lobby. Finally received our bags 2 days later. Flight to Krakow was late (we got our luggage). They again lost our luggage on the flight to Budapest. Business Class was nothing special but the food was ok. We had a lot of trouble getting a glass of wine before dinner. Food service on the economy flights were either a sweet or salty roll and something to drink. Their coffee is terrible! The planes were OK - seating is a bit tight but they are an economy airline. If you need to check baggage fly Lufthansa.	0
I used to love Air Berlin and the quick connection and passport control when coming in from NY and connecting in Dusseldorf to Stuttgart. After my last 2 experiences in Stuttgart I will not fly them again. Both times on the return trip and after going through security they called me to re-route my flight. They make you go out of security then go to one counter and then to the priority counter. I have a roll bag that I carry on to Germany. On my first check in it is no problem to take it in. Once you have to go back out and check in the second time she makes you check it in to NY. Customer service on the flights is great. The ground team and systems in Stuttgart are awful.	0
"Now while I like the color scheme on exterior of aircraft the rest of the experience does little for representing Air Canada. I am tired of these ""low cost"" airlines by the main stream airline. Those had to be some of the most uncomfortable seats we have had to endure. Window and aisle going over and middle section back YVR-HNL-YVR. In fact the middle seats were better with room. The inflight entertainment system is a joke even as I knew to download the app on my iPad but the movies and all others were old ""vintage"" movies from 10-20 years ago! I will do my utmost to avoid Rouge in future even for my ""leisure"" travel. Friends of ours were stuck in Barcelona for 9 hours due to a aircraft issue in June 2015 and co-worker was stuck in HNL for same amount of time due to same reason, I see in thread this seems to be a recurring theme (maybe the aircraft are getting to old that have been taken off the main line of AC to support Rouge). The inflight crew seemed over whelmed and those uniforms are ugly. The service was slow and I had to remind several times I pre-purchased in flight food. When I fly AC main line they seem to know by my seat assignment and mention it to me."	0
Check in was chaotic due to bag drop desks being used for full check in. Baggage once tagged had to go to a separate area to be weighed thus taking the staff away from their desk. By the time we got through security the flight had boarded but there were a number of stragglers who boarded after us and delayed the flight. Seating in row 20 was good for a long haul flight with AVOD which was a step up from Air Canada rouge and the options were reasonably up to date with a decent choice. Toilets were also a good size. Service was fine but food was a disgrace - it was described to me as the Asian option, presumably because it was served with rice. The second meal was no better, inbetween these meals was a large sandwich stuffed full of chicken,  the odd water run now and then. Does not compare favourably with the competition on this route, even Air Canada rouge via Osaka is a better option.	0
Los Angeles (LAX) to Nuremberg (connecting in New York's JFK return portion was from Munich (MUC) to LAX via Dusseldorf). My wife and I paid for our seats to guarantee being together on both legs. It made no difference or sense in the end since the seats had no leg room. We were uncomfortable the entire time. Upon arrival in Dusseldorf (DUS) we found out that our connecting flight was cancelled with no other options available. Furthermore our luggage would not arrive at our destination until the next day! No explanations or no apologies were offered. Customer service was dreadful in Dusseldorf - rude and slow. I do not fly for the food or the entertainment. My hope is to travel safely and while on board to not be squeezed.	0
This was the most unpleasant trip we have taken. I had paid extra money for the extra leg room. We had got the seats right by the flight attendants station and by the bathroom. The service cart was constantly sticking out which made it difficult for people to pass to the bathroom and squeezing between my boyfriends legs and the service cart. The monitor with the flight information was wrong. The food was terrible. And the worst were the seats. You feel like you are sitting on the metal bar going across your lower back. On the way from Berlin to Miami they kept everybody boarding the plane in a small locked area separated from the shops and cafes without enough seating for everybody. To top off the trip when landing the flight attendant demanded to take away the pillow that my boyfriend was sitting on because it had to be put away for landing. At that same time the pillow and blanket were laying down on the seat behind me and they did not create any danger but the little pillow my boyfriend was sitting on was taken away from him. Ridiculous.	0
I travel quite a bit and have been a fairly loyal Air Canada flyer. I don't think I even realised that Rouge was different to regular Air Canada when I booked, but I will never travel Rouge again. The seat space was tiny (if the person in front of you has their seat back and you drop something on the floor, you cannot get it - there is not enough room to bend forward to pick it up - unbelievable). There was no entertrainment system, and the food was terrible. On the way home from Dublin, we were delayed by 14 hours because the plane we were supposed to be on had trouble leaving Toronto and there was no other plane. I guess Rouge does not use other Air Canada planes - we had to wait for a Rouge plane to become free. I will never use Rouge again. The price was no different.	0
"Boeing 767 on the way to Vegas and A319 on the way home. Boeing 767 decent in terms of space. Although we managed to get the exit row so I can't really judge the legroom in the regular seats but ours were great. Width of seats also great. Although we couldn't put our personal item (purse) under the seat so that was kind of a pain. A319 seats are decently sized in terms of width but the pitch is below industry standard. I rode the entire overnight flight with my knees pressed firmly into the back of the seat in front of me. I am only 5' 7"". My boyfriend who is 5'10"" found the trip excrutiating. The seat only reclines 2"" so impossible to sleep. The onboard crews on both our Rouge flights to and from Vegas were excellent - friendly, helpful and pro-active. On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an ""over that way"". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics.  I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers? Even when the flight is purchased entirely with aeroplan points it's not worth it."	0
"Last Friday I had a flight from Calgary to London Heathrow. My 9hr flight turned out as the worst flight I have had. After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people. Besides all that the food was not good at all. From the dinner plate I got, I only ate the brownie."	0
The service on checking in my bag, going through US customs and moving through security was shocking! There were a maximum of two employees working at any stage and that meant that it took me over 1hr 45min to get through to my gate. Fortunately my flight was delayed but if is hadn't been then I would have missed my flight for sure. The number of staff was abominable and it should not be that poor.	0
As a Super Elite Million Mile customer I have been loyal to Air Canada in the past. My Super Elite days will end in 2015. They switch many popular routes out of Vancouver to Rouge. My one and only trip on Rouge to Hawaii was terrible. Uncomfortable business seats, teens as flight attendants were confused. Secondly, the new business configuration in order to cram in more customers is the worst I have flown on. Impossible to lie flat as there is no space for your feet and the serving tray is like a guillotine when opened. Thirdly, they significantly increase the e-credits required to receive an upgrade and at the same time cut in half the Aeroplan miles earned on short haul flights. I cannot find any positive change. As a result I have switched to WestJet Plus and Alaska.	0
Flight from Barcelona to Munich. Flight was an hour late. Entering the plane was like entering a discotheque loud music plus screens with advertisement everywhere not comfortable at all. It was cold in the cabin throughout the whole flight. And somehow I did not get any food in the plane although it should have been provided. Would never use this company again.	0
Instead of a non-stop flight to Palma de Mallorca of 1hr 45mins the airline changed the flight routing. We first had to fly north to Dortmund Germany. Total travel time was 4 hours! Plane was totally full. The seat numbers were not correct the staff did not care. No drinks served during this 1 hour flight. Cabin crew disappeared after take off. Arrived at Dortmund told to remain in the aircraft but after a while we all had to leave with our hand luggage to wait at the gate for re-boarding 15mins later. Seating number problem still not solved. Families who were promised to be seated together complained to staff flight attendants were rude and arrogant. After take off finally drinks were served in tiny cups and a dry mini sandwich served. At Palma airport the plane was not docked to the terminal although most gates were empty. We had to leave the plane by stairs take a bus and walk all the way to the arrivals hall.	0
"I will never fly Air Canada again. Before boarding, they warned us the toilet was inoperable. (Short flight, about 1.5 hours, so this is no big deal). While boarding, we had to leave our rollerboard ""carry-on's"" on the jetway, since the plane is too small to store them anywhere - the overhead bin is big enough for a laptop or purse. After boarding, we learned the air conditioning was half broken. I have never before been somewhere so hot and humid. Once we landed, we got to wait outside in the rain for our ""carry-on"" bags for 20 minutes, and several of us almost missed international connections because of this delay. In summary: no toilet, no air conditioning, and no carry-on bags."	0
I booked Air Canada via United website and had no idea that the flight leg from Montreal to Rome was Rouge. It was not identified on any communication. I had never heard of Rouge and I did not pay a discounted price. The experience was horrible. Hard, uncomfortable seats. No entertainment for international flight is unheard of in this day and age. They ran out of food selections and what was left was hardly edible. The worst part was the plane smelling of urine the minute one entered the cabin. Never again.	0
I returned to Canada from Lima Peru on an Air Canada Rouge flight that left Lima at 2.15 am. Air Canada's flight arrival and departure times to Lima have always been inconvenient-arriving in Lima well after midnight, if the flight is on time, and departures for the return flight to Toronto leaving Lima at around 2 am. I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra. For entertainment you can supply your own mobile device and use the inflight service, if you don't have a device you can rent an ipad for $10. The Rouge Premium seats at the front appeared to be marginally superior to economy but come at a steep price differential. To be fair, the crew did their best, although the pilot gave little information with respect to the flight. Never again.	0
"Flew from New York to Beijing via Toronto in May and coming back June 11th. I was badly surprised by the lack of professionalism of Air Canada FA. I was spoilt with hot liquids, water and juice 3 times during the flight from Beijing to Toronto, by different FA. Full flight both times, no smiles and kindness from any of the flight attendants, they were rude and seem to be very upset with some of the passengers. Our flight from PEK-YYZ was delayed due to two passengers missing, and while waiting on board, one of the FA's over the microphone said ""Perhaps we should give a round applause to the two passengers missing"". I find this very disrespectful and inappropriate. Overall, not a pleasant flight, rude cabin crew who shouted for people to remain seated, they didnt seem to care for passengers and they we were just doing their job with minimum standards. Very disappointing experience with Air Canada."	0
Vancouver to Toronto, AC 132 and Toronto to Baltimore, AC 7936. 6/5/15. We just returned from a wonderful trip to Alaska. We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow. We finally get through and are told the system is down and they can go nothing to track our bag. We did get our bag. The experience from start to finish was unpleasant and there were no apologies offered.	0
The trip did not live up to expectations. On line seat selection is free 30 hrs before travel so opted for this to save time at the airport. Onboard the aircraft staff were surly and struggled to smile. They enforced safety rules and procedures with an iron fist. One business man was immediately reprimanded for standing and stowing his jacket as the main door had been closed. Seat belts were worn and tatty. All announcements from the cabin crew were rushed making them hard to understand. The only advantage I can see is the use of T2 at Dublin airport.	0
This will be my last flight with Air Canada Rouge. We upgraded to premium, that was a joke, 9 hours of discomfort, crowding, childish flight attendants, poor food and overall the worst flight I have been on. I have always flown Air Canada due to the part of the country we live in (other airlines are unavailable) so it would appear that I either stay home or drive to a larger center to obtain seats on another airline.	0
Flew from Athens to Toronto on June 11th.  We think this is probably the worst airline we have flown.  None of the overhead reading lights worked so reading wasn't an option.  We were never I formed prior to boarding that we needed to download an app for entertainment and there is no connectivity on there is no connectivity after	0
boarding.  Not to mention the cramped seating and lack of leg room.  I can't say enough about never flying this carrier again.	0
"Dusseldorf-Berlin-St Petersburg. We checked in easily at the machine. At bag drop our Russian visas were very carefully checked. Boarding smooth for the first flight and our bulkhead seats on the A321 had plenty of legroom. A drink and a very bready pastry were served. Crew were efficient and the plane operated on time. Bussed to the terminal at Tegel. The boarding of the flight to St Petersburg was poor. Although there are dedicated gates for flights to Russia there is no signage or information to indicate that before reporting to the gate you have to have your Russian visa checked (again) at a desk labelled simply ""Air Berlin service"". To enter the departure lounge you have to pass through passport control. As we could see that the lounge had no toilets and not having been informed about the need to have our visa checked again we and many others decided not to go into the lounge until just before boarding time. At that time we were directed to join a long queue where a single employee was slowly checking visas. All the while Air Berlin announcements were telling people to board the plane immediately as it was about to depart! The whole mess could be avoided by clear signage and information. Once on board the A320 the seating and basic lunch were fine for a 2.5 hr flight - although loud chatter and giggling among crew in the galley during descent was a bit unprofessional. Again we were bussed to the terminal."	0
When we booked the return flight from Europe on Air Berlin as a part of our round trip booking through American Airlines we were told that the Air Berlin flight from Berlin on business class would have lie flat seats (not true and the seats sere very uncomfortable). We were told that the connecting Air Berlin flight in Berlin would not require that we go through security again (not true). The food and service in business class were very poor. The cabin was hot and the attendants either could not adjust the temperature or did not pursuant to our request. The Air Berlin website cannot be negotiated to see the seat layout and select seats hence we had to rely on the Air Berlin representative telephone conversations as to location of seats. Our seats were changed 3 times without any notice. Sound quality of the entertainment system is very poor. The information regarding status of the flight and time of arrival on the entertainment system was grossly inaccurate.	0
We recently took an Air Canada Rouge flight from Athens to Toronto, and once was enough: Never Again. The service was friendly and efficient, and the pilot updated us regularly on arrival info and turbulence, but there were few other positives. The seats were very cramped and uncomfortable. There were no individual monitors for entertainment, instead, passengers have to use their electronic devices or rent an I-Pad. Since my husband and I don't use electronic devices, we went old school and read whatever magazines we happened to bring with us. The food on board was terrible-worse than other food we've had on airlines. And AC Rouge charges for beer, wine, etc. All this for a price that isn't any better than other options. Next time, we'll go with the other options.	0
May 23rd 2015 we flew Air Canada enroute Fort Lauderdale - Ottawa - Frankfurt. From FLL to Ottawa we flow with an E-190 and Ottawa - Frankfurt with 767-300ER. All flights were on time without any delays. FLL-Ottawa: The Flight was full. A lot of cruise passengers were on board this flight. We had the last row in this small aircraft. The restrooms were at the end and they were very busy. Ottawa-Frankfurt: The Service was very poor. We had a Seat in the last row and we got only veggie meals. Unfortunately they had no more meat meals for us. The beverages were poor too. No more Coke Zero after 1/3 off flight time. They had enough Alcohol on Board.	0
Last month flying from Montreal to Geneva. First the plane left with a delay of about 45 minutes after 2 hours in the air the airplane was detoured back to Montreal due to mechanical problem. Back in Montreal we encountered nothing but rude and useless staff. I had to pay for a cab and Air Canada only offered a voucher for 10 dollars. Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance). I had to call customer service in Canada to change another flight also with Air Canada to South America. Long story short try another company and do not spend you money on this company. I wish I had taken a flight with KLM or AirFrance. They were cheaper but with 1 stop.	0
MIA-DUS Seat 22 A+C. Check-in hectic but quick boarding slow typical for USA. Seat small and very uncomfortable with little leg room a no go for a 9.5 hr flight. Service sloppy. Drinks ok. The only good thing was the price cheap as this airline has now become. Next time I will use another airline.	0
We flew from Toronto to Vegas in conditions that can only be equated to a cattle car.  I am 5' 7 and my knees were pressed into the seat in front of me and the gent behind me had his knees in my back for 5.5 hrs!  There is no way to stretch your legs or move comfortably at all. My husband and I got off the plane aching and cramped from the deplorable conditions. It is obvious that AC cares for nothing but their bottom line, and I would sooner pay more and suffer layovers than ever fly with them again. Oh and the $60 bag fee each way was an especially nice touch.	0
"Just flew round trip Toronto to Bahamas on Rouge. I'm only 5'8"" and couldn't believe how cramped I was. The passenger in front of me reclined his seat a bit and I could not do the same because the passenger behind me was working on her laptop. I briefly moved to business class which was almost empty but that didn't last long. I managed to watch a movie on my iPad which was okay but the selection was weak and dated. It got me there and got me back but neither flight was sold out and two more rows made it very uncomfortable for all. I couldn't imagine an overnight flight on this carrier."	0
I was involuntarily bumped from a UA flight 3803 (an Air Canada code share) from Toronto Pearson to Washington Dulles on April 12th. I was in transit at Pearson en route from Tel Aviv to Dulles with an original layover of 2 hours 55 minutes. My initial flight AC 85 from Tel Aviv was late departing and arrived in Toronto at 5.50pm an hour and 15 minutes late. That still left me more than an hour-and-a-half to make it to flight UA 3803 scheduled to depart at 7.30pm. After disembarking from flight AC 85 and reaching Pearson's passport control an Air Canada attendant advised me to go through U.S. customs and proceed to my gate. I arrived at the gate on time at 7pm when boarding was under way. When my boarding pass was scanned a UA gate attendant said I could not board because the Dulles flight was oversold and I had been bumped from the flight some time earlier. No reason was given for the bump. The UA gate staff told me to speak to Air Canada about booking another flight back to Washington and I later had to cross the border into Canada and stay overnight at a hotel paid for by Air Canada. I boarded Air Canada flight AC 7354 to Washington DCA the next morning April 13th. After arriving at DCA I discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight. I spent 5 hours at Pearson trying to sort out the mess resulting from the bumped connection.	0
Do not travel with Air Berlin if you are over 6 feet tall. Leg room is unheard of and it is just very unpleasant for flights of 3 or more hours. Cabin crew are helpful planes are fairly new and I would probably fly them again within Europe if prices are reasonable but never again for long haul! Food not terrible nor great either. Also keep in mind that the seats themselves are very small and luckily it was me and my wife traveling together or else it would be a very uncomfortable experience to be pasted up to a stranger. We are both very skinny people and yet we were all up in each others personal space. I took carry on bags and did not checked anything in due to hearing all the horror stories of lost baggage and I recommend you doing the same if your trip is short enough but keep in mind it needs to be under 10kg.	0
Dub-Orlando. What a poor effort by Aer Lingus. Entertainment systems on flights over and back kept breaking down so whole system had to keep getting rebooted. Kids were served one drink the whole flight then tea or coffee 45 mins before landing.	0
Flew AC Rouge to and from Curacao from Toronto May 21st and May 28th. I would like to echo everybody else's sentiments about just how small the seats are. I'm 5'2 and found it to be a very cramped space. I cannot imagine how uncomfortable it must be for a much taller person. The headrest is useless. When the seat in front of me was reclined it was approximately a foot away. On both flights I found the planes to be very clean and the cabin crew very professional making several cabin walks throughout the flight. I used my Ipad and managed to find a couple movies to watch using the app. There didn't seem to be anything current available the movies I watched were released in 2008 and 2010. The food was your typical airline food no better or worse than I've had on other airlines. The afternoon flight to Curacao left on time and arrived on time. The return flight was approximately 9 hours late departing at midnight. Trying to get some rest in these seats is an impossible feat. This is the main reason I give my overall trip satisfaction a 2 rating. Although I'm used to paying for food and alcohol on flights I was completely taken aback to be charged for a sandwich after a 9 hour delay. I guess that's AC for you. As for if I would travel AC Rouge again possibly during a daytime flight if the cost was significantly less than a regular airline. If it were a red eye I would pay to upgrade or choose another airline to fly with.	0
Toronto to Varadero and back. It is unbelievable how much they are willing to test the patience of their travelers. I'm only 5'5 and I found the seats to be extremely cramped. I could barely handle the 3.5 hour flight - I don't know how people handle a 7-8 hour flight. While the staff were helpful and friendly I was shocked that you have to pay for food and alcohol pay for a blanket and pay for on board entertainment. Why are we moving backwards. I remember the time when there used to be one large screen for an entire section then we progressed to individual entertainment systems and now we aren't back to square one - but we have regressed! If you are going to start cutting corners like this then at least reduce the airfare! What is Air Canada thinking? Never again.	0
Flew Toronto to Heathrow. Much worse flight than on the way out. We paid a hefty extra fee for exit seats which had no storage whatsoever and not even any room under the seats. Ridiculous. Crew were poor not friendly. One older male member of staff was quite attitudinal acting as though he was doing everyone a huge favour by serving them. A reasonable dinner but breakfast was a measly piece of banana loaf. That's it! The worst airline breakfast I have had.	0
2 domestic flights in mid-March (FRA-TXL TXL-MUN) as prices were very reasonable. Flights themselves were unremarkable and indeed I was surprised that snacks were handed out on such short flights (1 hr 25 mins). Biggest complaints have to do with having to take a bus to/from the gate out to the planes. Additionally the boarding process and check-in area for domestic AB flights at TXL is horrible! AB ground staff are rude and unhelpful. Ticketing/check-in/boarding area for Tegel is one of the most inefficiently planned and run CFs that I have ever had the displeasure to experience. Combine that with no train line to the airport (just a severely overcrowded and unpleasant bus route to get to Alexanderplatz or Hbf). Will avoid flying out of TXL at all costs.	0
Flew Abu Dhabi to Phuket . Flight was most uncomfortable hardly any leg room seats uncomfortable rude cabin crew awful food. Seat back television broke down a couple of times and had to be restarted. Would never travel with them again.	0
"My wife and I and friends just flew Montreal to Las Vegas return with them. I am a large man with long legs I fit in a normal seat width-wise but I cannot pretzel my legs sufficiently to deal with the lack of legroom. Because of this I reserved and paid extra for one of the extra-legroom seats on the emergency door seat 18F to be exact. Air Canada Rouge happily accepted my money and emitted the corresponding receipt but on obtaining my boarding pass I discovered I had been reassigned to 15A which on boarding the plane I discovered was a normal ""meat packer"" seat while someone else had been given 18F. It turns out that their business practice is to sell those seats to anyone but they only actually assign them to passengers at the check-in counter. To avoid a repeat we showed up for our return flight 10 minutes before the check-in counter opened. We were first in line yet my reserved and paid for extra-legroom seat had already been assigned to someone else. This is shoddy way to do business. I can understand that seats on the emergency aisle should only be assigned to passengers who will be able to help if they are called upon to operate the emergency door (something which I am perfectly able to do) and therefore should only be assigned at check-in but that being the case why allow someone to pay for and reserve one in advance when the reality is that they are assigned on a first come first serve basis by the staff at the check-in counter?"	0
May 18 2015. Barcelona to Toronto. Forced to take Rouge from Air Canada since that's what they use. Cancelled the non-stop flight on the Sunday and moved us to the Monday non-stop. Had to come on the Sunday so ended up going by way of Montreal. Was charged an additional $90 for seats with some leg room. No entertainment on a 9 hour flight. If you wanted to see something you either had your own tablet etc. or you can get an I-pad from them for $10. Food was so-so. Check in counter at Barcelona Airport was a disaster. They don't have kiosk where you can check in and print your boarding passes and luggage tags. After about an hour in line I was finally able to check in on line and proceed to the separate line to check your bags. 4th in line took 25 minutes. By the time we finally got through all the lines (Security  Immigration) we had 20 minutes to run to the gate. By the way the airport was in total disarray and major staff shortages for the thousands that were in the terminal. Everyone was being fed into 2 lines at each point. Almost had to take the Monday flight after all.	0
"Flew YVR-OGG (Maui) return this month with my husband (6') while I am 5'4"". We had seats 42H and 42K. On the outward bound flight the air was blasting so much I was frozen and to make matters worse I was suffering with a pinched nerve in my neck. I was unable to put my head at the correct height on the head rest for any support as I am too short to reach it. I couldn't lean against the window (even though I had my own pillow and a special neck support collar) as there was a gap which my pillow would fall through. The return flight was even worse starting with check in at the airport. If you haven't done web check-in which isn't always possible while on holiday you have to wait in line while those people who have take their baggage to the agents. They had 3 lines one for priority one for web check-in and one for everyone else. There were 4 desk agents dealing with passengers. The flight was a red-eye and I was prepared for the blasting cold air but my husband had to borrow my scarf to cover his face and head because he was freezing. The flight crew tried hard but they are really not very professional. I never used the inflight entertainment option because using and iPhone or iPad was not something I could do with my neck issue. I had no idea when I made my reservation that there was no seat back entertainment. That has always been one of the Air Canada pluses - they have great movies. The only thing I can is the flights were on time both ways but that is no excuse for this poor show. What is Air Canada thinking? I have always flown them by choice and supported them. Their regular airline is great and their overseas business class for Europe is my first choice all things considered. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again."	0
Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.	0
"AC1828 Kahului OGG to Vancouver YVR April 30th. This was one of the worst trips on Air Canada that I have experienced. Really how many people can they jam on a plane? The seats were so close together I had trouble and I am only 5ft two inches tall. I cannot imagine how taller people manage or bigger people for that matter as the seats are also very narrow. The seats barely reclined maybe and inch or so. This was a long flight 5.5 hours with no food offered. Drinks of just tea coffee water and some soft drinks offered only twice in the whole trip. Not sure what the attendants do in all this time. The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country. The flight crew had the nerve to say on leaving ""Hope you had a good flight"". Obviously they have never flown in economy on this flight. My neck ached so badly after this flight."	0
"5th May 2015 Vancouver-Heathrow. Food terrible - take your own picnic. Cabin very busy and didn't look too happy. Seats not great either toilets kept clean. Generally a ""tired"" airline. Won't use them again."	0
Connecting flight from OSL through TXL to FRA. Flight from OSL delayed. Connection in TXL to FRA could have been reached but Air Berlin did nothing to support connecting passengers (direct bus transfer) and even after running to the gate boarding was denied with the aircraft still at the gate! Re-booked to next flight to FRA more than 3hrs later. No support whatsoever. After finally reaching FRA suitcase was still in Berlin. Today (2 days later) the luggage still hasn't arrived.	0
Flight Munich-Fuerteventura-Tenerife (back: TFS-MUC). Poor service: only a sandwich although we were onboard for more than 5 hours (with one stop in Fuerteventura where we had to stay on board). From the 5 meals you could buy there were only 2 available (cost more than 10€). On the way back our video monitor didn't work and we only had 1 music channel working. Worst of all: very unfriendly crew. We flew already with TUI-fly and Condor (Thomas Cook) to the Canary Islands and had a much better service and friendlier staff on board. I won't say: never again but if I can choose between Air Berlin and another airline Air Berlin will be the loser.	0
Had a bad experience on the flight from Athens to Toronto on 5/24/2015. The service was slow no entertainment information prior to flight. 13 hours on the flight and had to movies TV shows because you need an Air Canada App to be able to view. Food was horrible and it was the first flight overseas by a major carrier that we had to pay for wine or any alcoholic beverages. But the biggest disappointment was the service of the staff. Never again will I spend the money to fly this airline.	0
"No onboard entertainment unless you've downloaded their app (good luck finding that). Horrible seating I'm 5'4""' and my knees were jammed into the seat in front. I got massive leg swelling because there is no room to stretch your legs. Service is non-existent - you have to go to the back to even get water from the attendants. Food beyond awful. Lunch was a pasta with no sign of veggies a bread roll something that was supposed to be a potato salad with 1 olive on top and little sign of potato and a cookie. 4 carbs no fruit and no veg? This was advertised as a Lufthansa flight operated by Air Canada it wasn't a discount fare and we didn't know it was a Rouge flight until we boarded. Never again! Shame on you Air Canada! These flights were Lufthansa 6625 May 10 and Lufthansa 6624 May 24. Wonder if Lufthansa knows that AC is destroying its reputation with this dreadful service."	0
Flew from Toronto to Lima. Flight was a half an hour delayed which is ok. Very little leg room. We requested vegetarian meals which were frozen when they arrived on our seats something that I think is unacceptable. Flight attendants did not speak Spanish which again is unacceptable when all other airlines flying to South America have staff that can speak Spanish. Definitely a downgrade from Air Canada for the same amount of money. Finally there is no entertainment system except for the Air Canada app which features a handful of old movies again very much downgraded product from Air Canada.	0
2 flights - Abu Dhabi to Phuket return. Insufficient leg room rude staff. We were stranded in Phuket on the return leg due to a broken aircraft. No one from Air Berlin appeared to know what was going on - we eventually left Phuket 25 hours late. Put up overnight after almost a full night at the airport in the most basic of hotels. Then our bags got left in Abu Dhabi. Will never fly with them again.	0
Jan 9 2013 Budapest to Bangkok on Air Berlin / Etihad. Budapest staff were helpful and the flight to Berlin went well. Air Berlin flights from Berlin to Abu Dhabi and from Abu Dhabi to Berlin on Jan 31st were horrifying. Each way it was a 6.5 hr flight in cramped seats with bad food and rude service. The stewardesses were virtually snarling. The food was almost inedible The seats were unusually small. The worst flying experience we've had. The Etihad part of the flights was excellent with great food pleasant service and comfortable seating.	0
I booked and paid for LAX-Shannon round-trip. Arriving at LAX on Friday they had screwed up my booking and made me fly standby. Their next flight wasn't until Monday so if I didn't get on the plane my vacation would be severely disrupted. Their counter person said he would try to help. He then vanished from the counter not to be seen again when I (thankfully) was boarding the plane. No word of apology from him or anyone else at Aer Lingus. Completely unprofessional.	0
"Malaga to Gatwick. Have flown the route a couple of times with Aer Lingus and I think they compare favourably with Easyjet. The plane was clean crew friendly and legroom was greater. One problem though. I had paid for 2 seats but my partner was unable to fly so I had an empty seat next to me. I was asked to give it up so that a father could sit with his young son. This I agreed to do but pointed out to the stewardess that I had in fact paid for the empty seat. ""No problem"" says she ""I'll organise a refund for the unused seat"". She took all the details but I heard nothing. When I contacted customer service (a feat in itself) to follow up I was offered £5 which after several emails was increased to £27.93 when I had paid over £100. I was told that cabin crew have no authority to offer refunds. Certainly won't be prepared to offer my seat again."	0
I used Rouge to fly from Toronto to Tampa and i was shocked what horrible leg room there was. The Cabin crew had nice uniforms however the service was rude and slow. The crew just assumed everyone was discount flyers who were used to horrible conditions. I will never fly this airline again. There should be some minimum standards for leg room and this airline does not meet that standard. The inflight entertainment was 5 years out of date but at least it worked to my laptop.	0
I flew from Montreal to Athens. Although the flight arrived on time the 9 hours in the plane were a nightmare. Seats extremely small staff inexperienced and rude food horrible entertainment non-existent cabin dirty and smelly and they charge extra for things such as a simple glass of wine. I will never fly with Rouge again.	0
Our HND-YYZ flight was 12 hours long so it's pretty important to fly with a good airline. However we have very rude and unfriendly service extremely bad food (they just skipped me with the second meal). My husbands outlet wasn't working and the flight attendant answered to my polite request to help with luggage (there was no space above our seats).	0
Flew Abu Dhabi to Phuket. As it was almost impossible for me to fit me knees into the seating area they fell into the aisle when I finally dozed off slightly. I was abruptly awoken by a male flight attendant who knocked me with a trolley. I awaited an apology but instead was yelled at for having my knees in the aisle. The other flight attendants did their utmost to make us feel as uncomfortable and unwelcome as they possibly could. It was as if they were going out of their way to be rude and unfriendly. Our return flight (mid October 2012) which we were dreading was delayed by over 2 hours. No staff available in Phuket to advise what would happen with our connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London. When we finally boarded we were again met be extremely rude and unfriendly cabin crew. Flying Ryanair would be considered an upgrade from this. AirBerlin are definitely the worst airline we have had the displeasure of flying with and it is unacceptable that they are part of the OneWorld alliance. If you like flying low cost airlines with appalling service then you will love AirBerlin.	0
Business trip from Stansted to Dusseldorf. Outward trip went fine. On return checking in at Dusseldorf was told flight was cancelled. No explanation given. Re-booked on BA flight that evening but this landed in Heathrow and my car was left at Stansted. Air Berlin failed to transport me to Stansted.	0
Took AC Rouge to/from Toronto-Las Vegas (Business class). Returned today May 18th. Flights left/arrived on time. Outbound crew was attentive professional and personable. Inbound team was 'average'. Ran out of 'healthy' food choice (despite the fact that bus class passengers paid higher fares). Massive confusion on the return flight (5 people booked in same seat). Biggest problem (as is often the case with Air Canada): baggage (again return flight). Passengers with checked luggage were sent to the wrong carousel and waited nearly 1 hour before a passenger located the correct one - with no help explanation or apology from Air Canada ground staff. Tight seating even in Bus. class. Free iPad with higher fare (my husband used one I didn't) with good in-flight entertainment.	0
Air Canada are a disgrace. Flew from Vancouver to London. I was astounded at how little leg space there was for passengers and I'm short myself (5'6). It is simply impossible to get out of your seat if somebody is asleep. It is simply inhuman to put people into such cramped conditions for nearly nine hours. I don't know how they are allowed to get away with this. Are there no regulations governing minimum legroom on aircraft. You wouldn't transport animals like this.	0
Flight 835 MCO-YYZ. Flew on them a few months back and I must say I was not impressed. Reading all the other reviews I assume that all the good ones were written by people shorter than 5'5. With its cool new cabin layout and the stylish cabin attendant uniforms it could easily be someone's favorite airline but with the drastic decrease in leg room I cant see myself flying them again. There was so little leg room I had to sit in the bathroom for the last hour of the flight. I am never flying them again not until Rouge goes belly up and the regular Air Canada flights start coming back to the Bahamas.	0
"April 26th CPH-YYZ. I fly to Europe or Asia every month. Status is Super Elite. I was excited to take my first Dreamliner flight. Get to the airport at 10am for a noon flight. While in the check-in line somebody mentions the flight is delayed - by 12 hours! No call no warning no SMS ahead of time. Terrible customer service. Only one SAS guy capable of handling re-bookings. It was painfully slow. The 4 out of 5 ""Staff Service"" is for the lone AC employee I saw who did her best to calm people in the line down. Even my Trip-It Pro app didn't get any update feeds from AC about this flight. Shameful! I was eventually re-booked through FRA arriving at YYZ six hours late."	0
I flew out of Hong Kong to Toronto. I tried to book my seat online as offered by the Air Canada website 24 hours before my flight but the system would not allow me to do so. I was sick with the flu and requested to get an aisle seat 5 hours before my flight at Hong Kong airport. I was then told that the airplane was overbooked and that no aisle seats were available. I was told to go to the Air Canada counter to request one. To my great surprise their is no Air Canada counter in Hong Kong airport. I was then told to go to my gate and ask the personnel there which I did and they offered an end of the plane seat without a working TV. This was unacceptable for a 14 hour flight. I was then told to keep my mouth shut and keep the seat that was originally assigned to me. I travel for a living and this kind of service I have never seen before not even from discount airlines like AirAsia or Cebu Pacific. Next time I will know better and save some money by booking with a discount airline from which I can get the same service or better.	0
We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket on 11 December and returned to Abu Dhabi from Phuket with Air Berlin on 27 December. Flight out delayed by a few hours and all the crew had to say was that it wasn't their fault. Eventually there was an announcement that we were going to be given a glass of water! On the fight back one of the cabin crew plonked a meal in front of my husband who asked if there was a choice. The flight attendant told him there was only chicken left. No drinks service before our meal and the food wasn't up to much. Not all the crew were surly but most made you feel that you were a nuisance - even though we didn't ask for anything! Very poor service.	0
Flew code share (I thought I was flying Etihad) from Abu Dhabi to Phuket. All in all quite poor flying in business class poor food and seat no lie flat very uncomfortable bad choice of movies. On the return leg they did not have enough food so I did not eat a main dish cabin crew apologised but did not offer any options. On the whole I found the crew to be quite rude and unhelpful. I will not use Air Berlin again and would not recommend them.	0
"Flew Toronto-Athens May 10. On the plus side the flight left and arrived on time. The in-flight experience was horrible. Seat pitch is so tight that my husband and I (5'5"" and 5'4"") were very cramped. No entertainment unless you have their app otherwise you have to rent an iPad for $10. They don't tell you in advance that you need the app. No service for the first 2 hours in the air then they came around with soft drinks never came round with these again. The only after-dinner choices were coffee tea or water. Food was awful. Neither of our overhead lights worked and my switch worked the light for the lady at the end of our 3-seat row. I've flown discount airlines before but have never felt as I did on this that I was an inconvenience. I will never fly Rouge again I didn't know when I booked the flight that it was a Rouge one - I will double-check in future. Air Canada has lost me as a customer."	0
Flight AB7417 from CUN-DUS on 29th Dec 2012 on A330-200. Called their serviceline to reserve seats for my wife when checking in I was told there were no records. In the end got a 4 seater for me and my wife with the comment that they would not be able to guarantee until boarding would be completed. Since plane was only 70 % full it finally worked out. Lounge access: Although clearly mentioned on their homepage for their Gold Members no voucher for their contract lounge later in the lounge sent away due to I could not provide them with a voucher! Onboard IFE not working properly even reading lights could not be operated. When asking one FA to help she was very annoyed telling me she has other things to do. Finally she helped by resetting the lights. Food was not nice either. No drink rounds during a 9 hour flight with exception of meals. No amenity kits not even a small one for a night flight. No personal welcome or care for their status pax at least not for me whereas they seemed to be very caring about one more status pax 2 rows further front. Out of more than 30 long-haul flights in 2012 this was by far the worst. Never had such an unprofessional unfriendly experience and will avoid for future trips! They might be acceptable for a short hop within Europe but their long-haul product is really bad both for the ground handling as well as on-board.	0
Düsseldorf to Fort Myers return 3 weeks later. The food was good no complaints. Flight service staff were very good - ground service staff not so. The in-flight entertainment was very good. There was a problem with one monitor. The problem had not been fixed on the return flight - we had the same seats on the same machine! My problem is with the reclining seats. They are very peculiar in that in the full sleep position the body is in a decline the legs and feet are lower than the upper body. A very odd position that I found most uncomfortable. The seats looked a bit worn for newly installed seating. Late night check-in in Düsseldorf left something to be desired. There were 4 counters open and just a handful of passengers checking in. The Business counter was dealing with a rather lengthy problem so we went to one of the economy counters. The woman at this counter practically snarled at us. For these reasons - poor service by the ground staff and the office staff I would hesitate to fly with Air Berlin again.	0
TXL-AUH AUH-TXL. Staff were surly and unhelpful. We were travelling with an 18 month old and they gave the bassinet seats we had requested/reconfirmed to two men instead of us. Food was terrible service was non-existent. Plane was old and poky considering length of flight. Never again.	0
We flew from JFK to Tegel. The flight was over an hour late taking off and no explanation or apology was given. No dinner provided and a very poor explanation given for this ie there was a potential for clear air turbulence although during the flight we experienced little turbulence. Breakfast was provided but it was cold and of very poor quality. My wife had no audio for her in-flight entertainment and staff were unable to rectify this. All reading lights that were switched on were unable to be switched off so it was very difficult to get any sleep. The seats were uncomfortable and tended to tip you forward. There was no information provided about destination time or weather and the travel map on the in-flight entertainment did not work. Also no one could provide information about our next flight out of Berlin in spite of us having a forward booking e- ticket indicating that there was a service to be operated by Air Berlin. The general demeanour of staff was surly or apathetic. Without a doubt we would never choose to fly Air Berlin again.	0
Trip was from Dublin to Toronto to Vancouver and back to London all on Air Canada. In trying to bypass London on the way out we were booked on the first ever flight of Rouge from Dublin. It was several hours late food was awful staff were snipey leg room was non existent and there was no entertainment. My biggest complaint is that despite multiple correspondences with Rouge and Air Canada I have not had one word from them other that to say 'it's my own fault for not realising how bad it would be'. I have to make the same trip again shortly and am exploring every possible way of doing it without any flights on Rouge or Air Canada. This is very sad since I am a Canadian Citizen. Rouge should take note thousand's of people (who are complaining) are not idiots - time you wised up.	0
My wife and I just arrived this morning on AC flight AC99 from Rio de Janeiro Brazil to Toronto. The seats were very small and cramped but being in economy class we couldn't say much. The big Surprise came when the attendant brought our Kosher meal for both dinner and breakfast for us to open the seal. We were shocked with the portions. They were so small and only 4 tiny items for dinner and less for breakfast this morning. Even when Passover was over 3 weeks ago now we still got Passover meals for our dinner and breakfast. I called customer service today because our daughter is flying tomorrow with the same AC flight to see if something could be done in order to avoid old food for her and the answer was that whatever it is designed for her to eat it is already there for tomorrow night's dinner and they couldn't do anything. I'll definitely think twice in a different alternative next flight.	0
I flew from Victoria BC via Vancouver (AC 854) to London on 17th April 2015 at 18.40 hrs. The plane from Vancouver a Boeing 777-300 appeared new. The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish. If they change the configuration of those planes I will never fly Air Canada again.	0
YUL-YVR-YUL both legs on a tired looking A330-300. I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.	0
My outbound flight to Rome was delayed by almost 10 hours. Customer Service at JFK comprised a few hapless girls who did not bother to try and book any of the passengers on alternate flights. My return flight from Venice was rescheduled from 1.55 in the afternoon to 8.00 in the morning an incredible inconvenience requiring getting up in the middle of the night to reach the airport 3 hours before an international flight. These matters were made worse by the almost total disregard for the passengers or their schedules. Since my return to New York Air Berlin Customer Service has evaded replies to my letters for more than a month. It is bad enough for an airline to be sloppy. Fortunately most of my travels go smoothly. Inevitably I've occasionally travelled with a poor or weak airline. I will never fly with them again.	0
Air Berlin carrier for Etihad Abu Dhabi to Phuket December 2012. Crew surly and uninterested food and seats terrible no space. The flight was so bad I checked all my onward travel on arrival in Phuket and was prepared to pay for other flights if Air Berlin were the carriers for any other legs. If you have booked with them or will have a leg of your journey with them be warned and do something about it now.	0
"I purchased exit row seats ($20 seat selection + $60 ""preferred"" seating + taxes each way = $168) for my round trip Toronto-San Diego. I was mighty glad to have the exit row window seat on my outbound flight - even so I felt squished in like a sardine and had to keep my left arm folded over so as to keep the intimacy between myself and the poor man squished in/overflowing from the middle seat next to me from becoming completely indecent for 5+ hours. I checked in online for my inbound flight the night before but it was only when I got to the airport yesterday to check my bag that I discovered I no longer had preferred seating. In Air Canada's defence they advised that they had changed aircraft and the people that had bulkhead seats were given the exit row seats. So where did that leave me? In a middle/centre seat. Right beside the seat I had paid for. The fairly generous 4-star rating of the AC Rouge staff below was for the flight attendants only who were pleasant. Air Canada's motto should be ""We take the Service out of Customer Service"". Ground staff were completely nonchalant about the fact that I no longer had the seat I paid for. Oh and don't forget to download the AC app before you fly or you won't have any inflight entertainment. Well unless you rent one of AC's iPads."	0
I flew what you call business-class on Air Canada rouge from Montreal to Las Vegas had I known that the entertainment was a simple iPad or that seats were so small that a midget would find it tight or that the seats were made so hard that it felt like a piece of plywood and would hardly reclined never to say that their service was lousy for all these great reasons I would recommend everyone never to use Air Canada rouge.	0
Arrived Gatwick at 4am for 0640 flight to Malaga on 23 December only to be told my flight had been cancelled. Having been told by Aer Lingus and other airlines there were no more flights to Malaga until 27th I resigned myself to spending Christmas on my own so went home. At home 2hrs later I received a text informing me there is a special flight out at 11am - so went back to Gatwick and checked myself in. However the rest of my family who were due to fly out later that day weren't so lucky and their flight was cancelled completely with no 'special' flight available - so never made it so Spain for Christmas. My first experience flying with Aer Lingus was chaotic and disappointing and will not be using them again!	0
"I flew YVR to LAX (Airbus). Flight attendants were rude told me they couldn't help me put my carry on bag in the overheard compartment. I had to stomp on my bag for it to even go between my seat and the seat in front. Being the in window seat I was now stuck in my seat and am stuck with my bag half under the seat in front of me and half not with straps tangled at my feet. There was trash (used napkins/newspaper) in the pocket where the normal TVs would go. I am 5'4"" and my knees was almost touching the seat in front. I took out my laptop in hopes to stream the inflight entertainment pulled down the tray table and realized my laptop did not fit the table. Drinks came around and I had to deny my free drink because I had no room to put the drink down or to move or juggle a drink and a laptop. To my dismay my efforts of getting into a working seat position my streaming froze so I gave up and decided to take a nap. But a nap was impossible as they left all their cabin lights on for a 8.30pm-11.15pm flight and I was beginning to have a headache from the light. I had to wait until everyone was off the plane so I could shimmy my bag out from under the seat and slide it out from the window seat to the aisle. Flew a US airline on the way back and it was paradise compared to AC Rouge. If you really do wish to fly rouge I would personally pack an ipad mini that is already loaded with movies an eye mask and sports tape or ice/heat pack for your knees. Heck even bring a cushion because those seats are not comfortable whatsoever but that said cushion may also compromise with what little space you already have. And for goodness sake be kind don't recline your seat."	0
"April 19 AC 1838 YYC-PHX. Return on April 24 AC1839 PHX-YYC. The seat pitch is horrible! I am only 5' 4"" and felt squashed! I can't imagine how my husband would have fit had he been flying with me. I will not fly this airline again. I flew Calgary to Phoenix. Had no choice if you want to fly Air Canada to Phoenix you must fly Rouge."	0
"Flew from Sydney Australia to Vancouver on Air Canada and was truly a miserable experience. I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight. Complaining seemed pointless in light of the persevering misery of the overall experience; I and most of my fellow passengers just took it all in stride. I will never (at least wittingly or willingly) fly Air Canada again. When I got home a Canadian friend said ""You flew Air Canada? Sorry! They're terrible!"" Such a great country such a lousy airline."	0
YYZ-PEK - March 20 - April 11 - The staff who work for Air Canada must be really unhappy in their jobs - no smiles here. The food on board could be greatly improved. On the return trip we noticed that the dining trays in our row were dirty and had not been cleaned from previous passengers. The toilet was also unclean and that was at the beginning of the flight.	0
"DUS-AUH. When we booked this flight on Opodo it was listed as an Etihad flight. As we have flown Etihad a number of times and were always satisfied we were looking forward to this experience. It wasn't until a later stage - after purchasing the flight - that this part of our trip (to Australia) was listed as ""operated by Air Berlin"". After having had a considerably bad experience with them on flight from DUS to MIA two years ago we weren't too excited about this but wanted to give Air Berlin another try on a long haul flight. Sadly things turned out to be even worse than expected: The plane was old didn't have an entertainment system installed and the leg room would have been OK on a trip to PMI from Germany but not for a 6+ hour trip. Ridiculous! The flight attendants were rather bossy the food awful and we were in doubt if the a/c was actually working. To us the ""climate"" in the cabin is an integral part of the success of a flight. There was hardly any oxygen which makes every flight an unpleasant experience. Altogether it was a very poor experience. This might have been state of the art back in the early nineties but we aren't talking about Ryanair here. Why has Etihad agreed to a codeshare with Air Berlin? It is just like booking a four star hotel but staying in a two star room."	0
Abu Dhabi to Berlin on a A330. First time flying with Air Berlin and a disappointing experience. First problem was the lack of leg room. I'm 181cm and my knees were hitting the seat in the front while when reclined I had trouble stretching out. The second negative was the in-flight service. I can't remember the last time I came across such a sour and unfriendly bunch. No smiles and total lack of effort and interest. Half the food I didn't even bother touching it was so unappealing. One positive was the IFE which was modern and had a fair amount of choice. Air Berlin might be fine for short-haul but I will certainly not be flying long-haul with them again.	0
Gatwick to Malaga return. Was told to be at airport by 3.10am for flight at 6.10am. Gates were not opened until gone 4am by a very surly man. Same thing coming back - told to be at airport 3 hours before flight time but gates were not opened until 1.5 hours before flight. Not impressed. Have not flown Aer Lingus before. I suppose that's what you get for going cheap. Seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room.	0
Boston-Dublin A330 with 2-4-2 seating. New plane PTV entertainment friendly helpful staff and crew easy check-in on-time departure and arrival. Just one meal. Charge for all alcoholic beverages. Seats were cramped both width and leg room. Difficult to sleep since cabin lights were left on and crew was making frequent announcements throughout flight. Many were commercial announcements regarding tax-free goods. Dublin-Boston same aircraft type. Same pros and cons with one additional con - cost or change fee to re-schedule was €692. No forgiveness or consideration on non-refundable tickets. US passport control is now at the Dublin US flights departure gates. Easy to get through the passport control gates but the reduced space results in major congestion at the departure gates.	0
We boarded the plane expecting the worst. It was the same as any other discount carrier for the most part. The seats were average. My husband is 6'3 and we usually try to get exit row seats. It seems that on Rouge the exit row is considered premium seating and is an extra $250ish per person! His knees were hitting the seat in front of him but that's to be expected. We were really disappointed with the entertainment situation. The app that you are to download doesn't work for android. It will play music but no movies or TV shows. There are plugs between the seats which is nice but they are on the ground and we couldn't actually reach them because the seats were so cramped. Charging for checked luggage has made most people use carry-on which means that there isn't enough room for all the bags in the cabin. All the reasons that we used to like Air Canada are gone. We will not be flying Rouge again.	0
"While I am 6'4"" I am hardly a giant and I cannot sit in the seats without my knees pushing into the seat in front. I was not informed at booking that it was a Rouge flight but I will avoid at all costs. I do not mind stripping amenities to reduce cost but making the seats so awful is ridiculous. What is this an airline for ants?"	0
"April 18 2015 HNL-YVR was delayed 4 hours which I've since learned is quite normal for Rouge. Passengers in the waiting lounge mentioned getting ""roughed"" previously to which all say ""this won't happen again done with Rouge"". Seats are horrible cabin temp uncomfortable lights stayed on for entire flight food non-existent in any form inflight entertainment dates back to 80's and flight attendants lacking in training and experience. This Low Cost Experiment by AC is a failure."	0
"Toronto - Milan Malpensa (MXP). At Toronto airport the monitors were showing ""on time"" but when I arrived to the gate boarding was almost completed. On board: dirty. Aircraft: old 767-300. No smile or help from the attendants (all over-head compartments were occupied by their equipment). Pillow and blanket: basic quality. Food: hot chicken low quality salad and cake. Cold bread given by hand by the crew. Breakfast: banana bread. 20 minutes later they came around with drinks and coffee. No magazine on board. Crew shouting loudly for duty free during night flight while people were sleeping. Wouldn't recommend."	0
YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. FB was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase. AC offers an expensive inconsistent product with unreliable on time performance.	0
The baggage drop off service on both Mon October 1st from Zurich (1 hr 10 mins) and the return flight on Thur October 4th at Berlin Tegel airport (1hr 25mins) is simply ridiculous. Why bother to check in on-line and then expect such a delay to drop off your bag. The staff counters were opened for 4 lines (incl business) at Zurich and 3 lines (incl business) at Tegel. I for one will never bother with Air Berlin again as I simply do not have this time to waste on such a pathetic level of customer service.	0
Have flown Rouge several times. The biggest issue in my opinion is seat pitch. I have been in Rouge and Rouge Plus. I won't fly with them if Rouge Plus is not available (only six seats on an A319). It also means they aren't much of a discount carrier if you have to add $40+ per seat in addition to the already higher fares. I am based in Halifax so a connection is the norm for me anyway. This makes the US carriers more attractive. Increase the seat pitch and a lot of the complaining will go away.	0
We flew rouge from YUL to Las Vegas on April 19th 2015 (flight 1855) and I was pleasantly surprised. Plane left late but not too bad and crew was wonderful. I would have recommended it to anyone but on the way back April 23rd (flight 1856) it was a scene from a high school musical. The flight attendants could not have been more self absorbed teenagers. Worst on board service in my 47 years of flying. They were talking in the back for 4.5 hours. I couldn't even get a glass of water. Air Canada Rouge should have 1 older flight attendant that can get them to do some work.	0
YYZ-MSY on Air Canada and MSY-YYZ via EWR on United. Both legs in business class. Outbound to MSY on AC on cramped old CRA equipment. Not good enough for a three hour flight. Food was mediocre. Pieces of cold chicken thrown about on a few lettuce leaves. Overhead bins too tiny for carry-on resulting in bags being shoved under seats wherever possible by an overwhelmed and stressed attendant. Disgraceful considering the usurious fare charged by AC. Inbound on United was most surprisingly day compared to night. Roomy and comfortable 320 Airbus attentive attendants serving an open bar drink before takeoff and during flight to Newark excellent lunch provided with soup and chicken salad or a cheeseburger and potato salad as choices. Flight from EWR to YYZ also well managed even though only a one hour trip and comfortable on an Embraer with proper sized bins for hand luggage and spacious business class seating. On top of which return fare nearly half of what AC charged which is reason we flew United and from now on shall continue to do so in lieu of AC who have lowered their standards horrifically.	0
"I have been impressed with this airline before but they have seriously let me down. I had a booking Alicante to Lisbon via Palma de Majorca where I am picking up a cruise ship. I have just received an email from them alerting me to the fact that ""due to urgent operational requirements a flight time change could not be avoided"". Fortunately I looked closer and found that not only was there a time change but they were now flying me to Faro not Lisbon (no mention of this in the email). I then had to ring a premium number to query this. The person I spoke to did not seem to find it strange that people book a flight to Lisbon because that is where they want to go and that Faro some 300 miles away is no substitute. I have a cruise booked and an overnight hotel booked but now no flight. And to add insult to injury before ending the call I was asked if there was anything else she could help me with."	0
When we booked our flight it said nothing about it being Rouge as opposed to Air Canada. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed when we found out as we opted not to pack our Ipad and it's the only way to access inflight entertainment without paying. Our family's seat assignment on the way had one of us in front of the bulk head while the other three of us were behind it (which was not so bad). Even worse - almost everyone on the flight back was given seats one behind the other. Our 6 year old was given a seat by herself! Everyone in the plane had to jockey their seats to be with the people they were actually traveling with. Ridiculous to say the least. This is not the first time we fly AC Rouge (both economy and premium economy) and none of the experiences have been great. It's not the staff as they are very friendly and accommodating its the actual aircraft. Terrible!	0
"Ranked one of the worst airlines in the world easy to see why. I've flown Rouge once and I'll never do it again. 29"" seat pitch (distance from seat to seat front to back) caused serious pain for myself and several other average-sized men on the plane. I can't imagine what would happen to someone who's actually tall. Talking to the Flight Attendants even they hate being on these planes as they put it ""it's a non-stop stream of unhappy passengers"". Avoid Rouge at all costs."	0
AC 1892 22/1/15. AC 1891 26/1/15. Had to sit sideways with my legs in the aisle for a 3 hour flight from Toronto to Tampa. If I hadn't had an aisle seat I would have had to get off I just didn't fit. I'll never fly them again.	0
Flight AC1844 on 23rd March 2015. 1) Flight due to take 1.5 hours but was 2 hours late. No apology offered. 2) I was a business class customer and due to be flying at lunchtime. No sandwiches were available in lounge at 2pm when we were due to be eating lunch on the plane. 3) Staff were extremely rude and unhelpful on both outgoing and incoming flights. 4) Same menu was served on plane for both legs of journey - 1 week apart.	0
Toronto to Ft Lauderdale via Montreal / return trip. Exorbitant price for an advance ticket only to find I was on standby for all 4 legs of the trip. Ticketing in Ft Lauderdale was atrocious! Kiosks didn't function properly lines were chaotic only 2 ticket agents available during spring break week and they were slow as can be. They stuck the baggage tags on the wrong tickets. Even the agent at the gate was fed up. I am submitting this review with her encouragement!	0
"Berlin - Los Angeles. I loved the non-stop service and the nice flight attendants but the food was sub-par and the ""new"" business class seats which will be replaced again in November to bring AB on the same level as Etihad were not comfortable. The also ""new"" VOD with bigger screens did not work for me either. All in all flying Air Berlin business class is still worse than Air New Zealand or Turkish Airlines Premium Economy which is a shame for the rather high business class fare they charge!"	0
We were on Air Canada Rouge flight from Toronto to Cuba and return flight was same. We are very disappointed with our flight experience with Rouge. No leg room no complimentary meals or beverages. Staff did their best to keep customers well served. There is more leg room in the Dash 8 that we took from Toronto to Timmins than the 319 we had from Toronto to Cuba. In the Future will make every effort to book with other airlines instead of with Rouge.	0
We were put on the AC1845 booked through Expedia the portion from Whitehorse to Vancouver was fine then AC Rouge to Phoenix made me think twice about ever flying again. On return we flew United to SFO great plane lots of leg room comfortable. SFO to Vancouver was a nightmare my knees still hurt and while I have never been an AC fan Rouge was the final straw. Nice looking uniforms does not a comfortable flight make. We were cramped no room for carry on. Almost claustrophobic temp hot seat lumpy and wedged between back and my knees. I am 6.1 could barely stand up after flight. I like the configuration United had 1st class then a number of rows with more space a number of rows with less leg room and then standard economy for the little people. I would be happy to pay a little more for the extra leg room or I may just drive the next time.	0
I flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Phoenix. I'm 5' 11 and had no legroom at all legs were tight for two days after. On the way back I upgraded my seat to row 4 right behind 'first class' get more room. Room was a bit better for and extra $40 but the flight attendant in first class was unbelievable. 5 of 18 seats were empty but she would not allow for anyone to take a pillow for use - this was a red eye flight. She actually reached over the seat from empty row 3 and pulled it from the window seat passenger and then woke up his wife to take the one she was using. Then she was rude about it when asked why. Inflight entertainment was awful- besides inconsistent connection- many had it reset several times- the content was bad. Bad leg room bad service and bad inflight entertainment. I'll never fly Rouge again.	0
Outbound Sydney to Vancouver (Sat March 14th) due to turbulence no tea of coffee - except that the flight was very smooth for the hours in which no tea / coffee could be served. Wed March 18th Vancouver to Sydney announced on take off that hot water machines not working so no tea/coffee for the 14 hour flight. I don't believe it! Service very poor. I almost wonder if staff are working to rule due to some kind of dispute. Went to the galley three times in the flight to serve myself some water. No one was offering.	0
Although it said online early am the flight from Mannheim to Florence was going to be delayed three hours on check in at airport the gate agent swore there was no issue and flight was on time. However ten minutes before we were to board they announced the three hour delay. After the three hours flight was cancelled. They could tell us nothing and getting any info in English was difficult. All non German speaking travelers couldn't get rebooked until the next afternoon.	0
We requested a ticket from Venice to Cologne/Bonn on May 21st and we were issued a flight AB8991 to Tegel Berlin with a 40 minutes stopover then flight AB6503 to Cologne/Bonn. Just as well we arrived at Venice airport early as four Air Berlin flights were leaving and only five counters were open. After 45 minutes they opened three more counters which meant we were checked in for our flight 1 hour 10 minutes after lining up. Given baggage receipts and boarding pass's to Cologne/Bonn. Flight was very good in all aspects other than we arrived Tegel at terminal C and were bussed to terminal C which was a delay. We then ran 800 meters to terminal A arriving at gate A6 at 16.45 hours. We were informed that our flight had left early also told we were not on their computer and nor was our baggage on this flight so they were not expecting us. They could not explain why we had onward boarding pass's issued in Venice. We went to their ticket office in terminal A and had superb service to ensure we caught the next flight to Cologne/Bonn. On arrival in Cologne our bags awaited us at the lost luggage area as they had come through on flight AB6503. A pity as in the air it is a good airline but ground staff wise it is way behind.	0
"YUL-HOG HOG-YUL 4/11 Apr 2015. We flew this leg same time last year (2014) and that flight was a ""real"" Air Canada flight not Rouge. This flight was a shock. I am 6'5"" so used to being a bit cramped on aircraft but ACR take it to a new level. The leg room is appalling I read about going long-haul to Edinburgh on this airline and would not consider it as 4 hours to Cuba was more than enough. The inflight entertainment was a waste of time the meals offered seemed pretty poor but the worse of all of this flight was the seating comfort. Future flights to Cuba will be with WestJet - AC have lost me as a frequent flier if this kind of cost cutting is their ""new"" business method."	0
March 27 AC1794. Most uncomfortable trip I took. Would rather stay home than travel with Air Canada Rouge. I am only 5 feet 10 and I could not move in the plane. I had to get up many time just to stretch.	0
In my past experiences I have found that even with a cancelled or delayed flight the airlines will typically be proactive in notifying passengers on board about other options or the status of their connecting flights. On my international flight which took off 1 hr late I received none of that. Even when going to the ticket counters to re-book my flights (after running to my gate and discovering that I had missed it) no one was on the same page. Some didn't print out new tickets they couldn't tell me where to go to get my luggage on the right track (which by the way I didn't get until almost 3 days later) and last but not least they flew me to a completely different airport in London without telling me of this change. On the way home from Europe same situation. 1 hour delayed flight (due to technical issues) causing nearly missed flight on other end. Wouldn't provide me with cart or tell me the status of my next flight and whether it would hold for us. Landed at final destination no baggage.	0
We flew on Air Canada Rouge last month from Toronto to Phoenix return. While this was our first experience with Rouge having had tremendous negative feedback about the very limited leg room my husband and I decided to upgrade to preferred seating before we left on our trip. The preferred seating was better than the regular seating for sure. However while we paid $160 extra to upgrade our seats our boarding zone did not change. This meant that we boarded the aircraft last because our reservation was booked using points. When we actually did board the aircraft the overhead bins near our row were all full. It seems reasonable to me that when a person upgrades to preferred seating at an additional cost they should board right after business class passengers and before regular seating. Until Air Canada discontinues the practice of having passengers pay for their one checked bag onboard storage space will continue to be a huge problem. When I paid extra to have preferred seating I would have expected preferred service!	0
"We have just returned from our eighth trip from Toronto to Grenada. This was our first trip on Rouge. The plane was the Airbus 319. The flights have left us scarred. There is no legroom and on a 5.5 hour flight no complimentary meal. We did download the Air Canada app for inflight entertainment but didn't find anything current or worth watching. This was our worst inflight experience ever! When I went online to understand the Rouge economy seat pitch (measurement of legroom) it does not mention it and I now understand why. There were 118 seats in the economy section and there may have been 5 empty seats at most based on what I saw. There were 2 stewardesses which I believe contravenes the 50 passengers to 1 stewardess legislation. Also there were only 2 toilets for the 2 crew in economy and all of the economy passengers. When a crew member had to wash their hands the washroom was the only place to do it. I would not call this ""leisure"" flying. Unfortunately for us this will be our last trip to Grenada unless the carrier changes or they re-fit the planes. Everyone at the resort we talked to was complaining about Rouge. The only positive thing I can say is the crew were very pleasant and helpful and I pity them because so many people were unhappy with the cramped quarters. Some men were actually sitting sideways for the entire flight because there was not enough legroom. Never again!"	0
On Friday Feb 13 2015 my wife and I were to leave Boston for Toronto enroute to Tokyo to see family. Our plane was 45 minutes late arriving in Boston but were we reassured that making our connecting flights would not be an issue. After we boarded in Boston we sat for another 35 minutes before the plane left the gate. Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo by 5 minutes. When we got to Toronto Pearson airport-which is the most unfriendly and confusing airport we have ever had the misfortune to be in-we got to our gate the plane was still there with the bridge still at the plane but we were told the gate was closed. After I informed them that if they could sit our plane for 35 minutes at the gate in Boston without moving then that would give us time to board our flight. We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service. Air Canada told us that they could not get us to Tokyo that day and that we would need to spend the night in Toronto. They paid for the room and some of our meals but the customer service was horrible. No attempts were made to book us with another airline as we have had happen in a similar situation in the past. Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time. Air Canada could take a few pointers from the competition. I will never fly Air Canada again and I will never fly into Toronto Pearson again. They both have much to learn about customer service.	0
Worst business class experience and not worth the money. The flight attendant was tired and made it quite clear to all of us in fact she actually expressed the fact. Passed the drink cart twice offered nuts and a bag of chips I asked for clamator and vodka got the clamato minus the vodka. Then she proceeded to sit where I could clearly see her reading a magazine and eating - very professional. When we were about an hour from destination the attendant got up and finally started breakfast prep then placed the cart in the middle of the cabin and started serving fruit plates 15 min later she served the hot breakfast not long after the descent started. Trays collected finally and still descending the coffee cups and juice glasses are still not picked up. This flight was not a business class experience and it will be some time before I take Air Canada business again.	0
Traveling Air Canada was the worst experience I have had. The agents were extremely rude and unhelpful in Toronto Pearson airport. Common courtesy seemed to have been an understatement. Flights were cancelled without proper notification leaving passengers stranded in the airport with no where to comfortably stay. Not sure if this is policy but agents were not required to assist with bag tagging leaving first time fliers lost and confused.	0
Totally devoid of customer service. Delayed yesterday coming out of Munich by 6 hours. No communication internet was better. No counter staff. The flight was to Majorca and I had an ongoing flight. The Majorca bound young holiday makers found the time to get very drunk in the wait and were therefore removed from the plane by police. They where allowed to board and then removed from the plane without air con. Bags off and more delays. Bag lost in transit no connection. Then to cap it off the return flight was delayed by another 6 hours.	0
Trip consisted of two flights Winnipeg to Vancouver and from Vancouver to Maui. The shorter flight from Winnipeg to Vancouver was onboard an Embraer 190. In economy there was adequate room to sit you could lower the table tray and if the person in front of you tilted their seat back it did not hit you in the face. The entertainment system the same one that has been used by Air Canada for a number of years provided a number of new or relatively new Hollywood movies. Once on the Rouge flight from Vancouver to Maui that all changed. The plane was a 767-300 which they have crammed more seats in over the regular 767-300. The seats seem thinner and more upright. My knees were touching the back of the seat in front. They have moved away from providing screens in the seat back facing you instead you have to provide your own screen a tablet laptop phone etc. Then you have to make sure you have loaded their“app”to play any content. Movies TV shows etc are broadcast via wifi. The older system on the first plane had four times the selection. Unlike the older system which is available even before the flight takes off this one was not online until about 40 minutes after we were in the air. On a flight that long a single charge on a devices battery is not going to last. When checking in for the flight home also Rouge from Maui to Vancouver I opted to upgrade the seats to ones promoted as having more legroom. Seats in the emergency aisle were advertised as such. For addition $60 per seat I selected them. More legroom was a lie. These were the seats right behind the toilets so even though there was more space between my knees and the wall in front of me there was nowhere to stretch my feet out whatsoever. There was no power outlet available. Being right by the toilets there was constant traffic and often unpleasant smells. I have been on overnight flights with Air Canada before a few times and always in the past to help make the passengers more comfortable and improve the odds of sleeping pillows and blankets were offered. Well on this Rouge flight none were offered and as the cabin did grow cooler and I inquired about them I was told that they were available for purchase! In all credit to the crew they just gave me a small one. The crew were friendly and helpful the plane itself looked long in the tooth. I have patronized Air Canada and chose them over other airlines for over 30 years but will I continue to do so? With this kind of service I don't think so.	0
We just completed round trip Toronto to Phoenix on AC Rouge - terrible! Seats are very small service is minimal boarding very slow because too much overhead baggage is allowed for first passengers on board. We stood in the jetway for more than 20 minutes waiting for staff to sort out baggage - unnecessary! Just enforce your own rules. A very poor alternative to reg. AC service. - bring it back please!	0
ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.	0
WDH-TXL. Flight attendants could be friendlier. Once in Berlin transit security staff in Berlin took me too late to the gate and I stood on the bridge and watched in dismay as my LHR connecting flight departed without me and my young daughter while security staff were busy talking on the ground next to my bumped luggage. 2 hours later security staff demanded USD2000 from me to rebook my missed flights via LHR to Chicago claiming that this was because I had no airport transit visa. When I explained that there was a fax from BA about my arrival and connecting flight and the tardiness of the security staff I was rebooked without charge but no apology. Air Berlin told me that they were not British Airways although the flight showed their name and number as well yet they simply cancelled my Chicago-Des Moines confirmed reservation on American Airlines without explanation. This is extremely poor service from a OneWorld partner.	0
The seats on our 11 hour flight to Dusseldorf were impossible for someone my size (6 ft 3 in). Legroom is so small that there was no way my feet could go under the seat in front of me. As a result my knees were bent at 90 degrees for the whole flight with pressure on my kneecaps the whole way. This was my most uncomfortable flight in my 3000000 mile flight history.	0
Took 8.55 am flight Berlin TXL to Frankfurt on a Monday morning. Arrived 2 hours before flight check-in area still not shown. Only shown 1.40 before departure. Get to the check-in area staff says go away. Turns out she is from Lufthansa. So we wait. 10 minutes later staff come along ignore us in the queue chatted with each other take another 10 minutes to set up. Printer not working has to ask neighbour for help. No instructions on where to go next. At 1 hour plus to departure I go to security. They say come back later. Flight itself was ok. FA ok. One drink and a roll. Bus to terminal. Luggage takes ages to arrive. Not pleased. Not recommended.	0
I did not know that our flight from Phoenix to Calgary was Rouge. I had been warned about it and was not impressed. I dropped something and was not able to pick up because there was no room. My husband's knees were pressing the seat in front. The flight attendants were serious. It was difficult for people to use their iPads. Not a pleasant experience and will not use it again.	0
Flew San Diego - Toronto route on Rouge. When I got in my seat literally had to get claustrophobia under control and I am not normally claustrophobic. Took out my laptop to watch a movie and the person ahead put their seat back and in the process almost wrecked the computer screen. Absolutely no room for a computer. There was no room for my legs had to sit with them crosswise. Measured the distance between seats the width of my eyeglasses plus two inches. Service was fine but my knees were so sore on landing it was almost a half hour before I could walk without pain and again I usually don't have sore knees. Fine to cut costs but you still have to leave room for the passengers please! Always loved and flew Air Canada but will avoid Rouge whenever possible and will now consider other carriers.	0
Appalling trip to Phoenix. Even at 5'6 my knees were crushed against seat ahead. No inflight entertainment endless queues for the two tiny bathrooms - for 120+ people? People lined up the length of the plane leaning on everyone's back rest as they waited to gradually make their way to a coveted toilet! My ill son needed a wheelchair to meet our flight in Toronto. Message didn't get through and we waited endlessly as crew asked us to leave the plane. Frequent flyer points be damned. Hello Westjet.	0
Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. I was forced to sit through a 8 hour flight from London to Toronto with no TV entertainment because their screen was faulty while other passengers around me had their TVs working. The staff on board thought offering me newspapers was a good alternative to not having TV entertainment which we all pay for as part of ticket costs! Its like asking me to eat carrots for 8 hours rather than giving me the solid meal I was told I would receive as part of the service. Unbelievable.	0
Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations. Worse no one seems to care about the stress and inconvenience caused by their unreliability. Wherever possible I would strongly suggest finding other airlines to utilize if and when possible.	0
Flew YYZ-YVR-NRT return. Very disappointing business class service really third rate compared to other international airlines such as Cathay Pacific or Singapore. Boarding the flight from Vancouver to Toronto was disorganized and there was no clear line for business class passengers had to speak up to get on the plane. Deboarding was just as bad and no priority deboarding for the business class passengers. The only reason I'd fly with Air Canada is my belief that they have well-trained pilots and well-maintained fleet. Again that could just be a perception and other Canadian carriers may have the same standards.	0
"MIA-DUS-BER. First impression was new airplane and very clean. Seats ok seat pitch compact. Staff correct but not very attentive and definitively rude when confronted. IFE excellent if you have brought your headphones or pay the €5 charge. The rest of the trip uneventful except for the very tired airport facilities at DUS and TXL. Return flight was nonstop TXL-MIA. Priority access only granted after insisting twice that we were Gold Status or OneWorld Ruby; nobody seems to have been instructed on what that means. Same plane IFE staff with a little better attitude though nowhere be found once they hand out ""the bottle of water"". Food was above average wine as always: one glass. Luggage handling ok. Rates are ok but same as other main carriers especially those belonging to One World. AB will have to do a lot to take advantage of their recent incorporation."	0
I just returned from Maui flying the only Air Canada option - Rouge. Never again if I can possibly avoid it even after being a dedicated AC client for over 25 years. If I was 5 foot 6 inches or smaller it might have been somewhat okay comfort wise. No in flight entertainment and nice but inexperienced attendants. Obviously a strategy to operate at a low cost but fairs do not correlate. Very disappointed.	0
I am a 75k elite member on Air Canada routes I would normally have flown Air Canada on I will switch to WestJet or a US airline. Great way to loose loyal customers Air Canada. I had to change a flight that now routed me through LA to Vancouver the last leg on Rouge. The seats were so uncomfortable and perhaps the tightest fit I have experienced when not in a private prop plane. I will never fly Rouge again and think about no longer flying with Air Canada.	0
Our booked trip from Rome to Copenhagen via Vienna with a 55 min transfer window in Vienna. After checking in we went to the appointed gate - we were there quite early so sat waiting at the gate for 1.5 hours. Our flight to Vienna was delayed 1.5 hours but no one could give us any information or help regarding our connecting flight in Vienna. We were told to keep checking the departure list and in the end 2 hours after the original time the departure list said that the plane was now boarding. Eventually 2.5 hours after the original take off time the plane was boarded and ready. When in the air we asked staff about our connecting flight which by now we had definitely missed they were very surprised to hear that there were people onboard who had connecting flights and they knew nothing. In Vienna there was one guy to help all passengers he informed us that we would be installed in a hotel in the airport for the night and that we would get on a plane home to Copenhagen at 6.25 am. Air Berlin had a special little extra surprise for us as this flight was not direct but had a stop in Berlin! Information was close to non existent and staff very unhelpful.	0
"The A319 was nicely appointed clean and lavatory serviced nicely. The crew are often the brunt of criticism but on this flight (3/16 YYZ-PHX) I couldn't praise the crew more. They were attentive two beverage passes and light meal cart and regular trips down the aisle with water for this 5 hour flight to PHX. Although young they seemed like they are really grasping the job and did so like other seasoned professionals on the big daddy airline - AC. For a leisure airline there is nothing leisurely about the experience. There is no inflight entertainment to speak of and the seating (oh the reviews about the seating) is absolutely horrible. Please Air Canada do something about the position of the seats - it's too tight! I would recommend Rouge for a trip of 3 hours or less. Do not book Rouge no matter how cheap you think it's going to cost for flights over 3 hours. Toronto to Jamaica - fine Vancouver to Vegas - fine. Otherwise it's an option but not priced well. For the product the price point is still too high. But good work on resolving some of the issues with the flight attendant ""kids"" that I've heard so much about. Air Canada please listen to me lighten up on the seating provide some fun on board like TV's and turn the product into a fun place to be."	0
Experienced Rouge for the first time this week while traveling to the US on business. The outgoing flight was late and I missed the connection. Seating is uncomfortable and cramped. There is no seatback entertainment systems and the wireless system has a very limited selection of old material. I don't get the impression that I was paying less for the flights. The leg that I flew on United was much better in terms of comfort and service and being on- time. Since I booked the flights on the Air Canada website in future I will first check to see if there are options on foreign carriers. AC and Rouge can pursue those who occasionally travel on vacation.	0
Recently I booked a flight through Airmiles from Phoenix to Vancouver BC and are supposed to return on Tuesday January 27th. My husband who flies hardly at all was appalled at the way everyone was crammed into the plane and he has refused to take the return flight back to Phoenix. We have booked another flight on WestJet at a cost of $740. I doubt if my husband will ever fly Air Canada again. We were not the only people complaining about the lack of leg room. I am sure if it weren't for AirMiles there wouldn't be anyone on these planes.	0
Flew AC015 from Toronto to Hong Kong. Prior to travel had to wait 25-35 minutes on long distance call to add special request. On board: They failed to provide the special meal. They were trying to blame it on me since I paid $120 for preferred seat. The flight attendant said she'll see what can be brought from Business class leftovers. They even failed at that so they brought me the side items of the meal (without the entree) which was awful. This was way too inferior to another European airline which I flew with last month. If that wasn't enough they ran out of water half way and at least one toilet got clogged. You couldn't wash your hands in the other ones! The Captain came on the speakers apologizing and explaining that the alternative would have been to land in USSR six hours ago but that they decided to carry on for many reasons. None was mentioned. Horrible experience overall. I'd avoid Air Canada on my future travels whenever I can.	0
TXL-AUH-TXL. Outbound flight to Abu Dhabi very lightly booked. Average meal was served and we got small bottles of water as an extra service. Old seat layout without in-seat entertainment. Return flight was fully booked. My seat reservation had been given away despite the fact I checked in 120 minutes ahead of the flight. The aircraft was fitted with new seats. The new economy seats were disappointing the pocket is too small to even fit an iPad or a bottle of water; and the passenger behind me used the touchscreen like a woodpecker waking me up every time. Before departure the crew told passengers would have to enjoy the entertainment system without sound. The sun started rising but there was no effort to close the window blinds. As promised the crew mercilessly started serving breakfast 120 minutes before landing. Again loud announcements that woke everyone up. All in all an unpleasant experience.	0
Took a flight from Toronto to Las Vegas yesterday. Scheduled departure was 8.40 am. At 9.00 they announced they were a bit behind and a plane was being towed to the gate. 45 minutes later still no plane and an announcement we're delayed to 10.30. At 10.30 an announcement they're still waiting on an aircraft and we can present our boarding pass to a few restaurants in the terminal for up to $10 worth of food and drinks. At 11.30 a plane arrives and we get boarded by 12. At which point they announce that the pilot and co-pilot have logged too many hours and we are waiting on a new crew. The new pilot arrives by 12.30 and tells us our plane was delayed because it had to be tested after getting overnight maintenance. She announces the co-pilot will be there soon. At 1.00 they announce that they need to reboot the computer system and we will be leaving shortly thereafter. By 1.30 the co-pilot and everyone seem accounted for but wait! We now have used so much fuel we need refuelling. We finally got underway at nearly 2.15 after waiting to refuel. This airline is a complete joke. As a Canadian I am embarrassed that they call themselves our national airline. All of these delays occurred after being forced to wait in Pearsons 'cattle pen' lounge for getting into Customs. We finally left at the same time we were scheduled to land. Numerous people on board missed connecting flights but the crew didn't seem to care. As an aside the crew seem very young and inexperienced and not well trained in how to handle these extreme flight delays with customers. If I could assign zero stars I would. The whole process was beyond frustrating I will always choose to fly via other airports and carriers when not forced to take Air Canada for work.	0
Weather delayed Montreal to Toronto flight on 01/04/15. Air Canada did nothing to rebook missed connections for people. My husband spent 2 hours on hold finally got to speak with an agent and walked her through the booking process because he had already found a flight with an open seat she was amazed there was even a seat on the plane. He started the 3 hour drive to Minneapolis where the Toronto connection was bound. 2 hours later Air Canada cancelled the flight from Toronto to Minneapolis with no explanation - and it wasn't weather. Worse yet they made one or two garbled announcements and that was it. My wife and the elderly lady she tried to assist were finally told they could only leave the secured gate area with an escort through locked doors gee guess Air Canada gate agents should have mentioned this when they cancelled the flight and told everyone waiting they would have to leave the gate area. Rude gate agents no directions on what to do to rebook just left their stranded passengers to figure it out for themselves.	0
Flight 7th Jan 2015 Heathrow to Vancouver 14.25. Terrible service waited over 2.5 hours before being offered a drink only offered two drinks in total for 9 hour flight staff were unfriendly. Food very average in flight entertainment poor. Terrible. Would not recommend to anyone.	0
Flight from Abu Dhabi to Phuket return. Codeshare with Etihad. Inflight entertainment zero seats small and service very mediocre. After serving an average meal the crew disappeared. On a 6-7 hour flight one would expect them to serve at least water between the main meal and the turkey/cheese roll before landing.	0
TXL-ZRH-TXL weekly. Most of the time very punctual crew not always friendly but watch out if the flight is late in into TXL on Friday evenings. Only passengers with connecting flights can disembark. I do have a gold card with AB as did several of the people next to me but still we were hindered in getting out by a loud FA. So far I have always booked them as they are cheaper than LH or Swiss but I will definitely review that.	0
Flew Berlin-Frankfurt which was fine. On the return Tel Aviv-Berlin. Flight delayed by an hour. No hot food just a sandwich - I expected a lot more on a medium haul flight. Staff were a bit rough around the edges and wore an awful black uniform. You had to pay 3 Euros for headphones to listen to the inflight entertainment. Money was the main motivation to fly them but not the overall service. Fine for short-haul but not for medium haul. The flight itself and landing etc were fine.	0
"AC 1808 YYZ-SXM Jan 31 2015. AC 1809 SXM-YYZ Feb 21 2015. Having read all the reviews was prepared for the worst. And it was worse than the worst! Yes we were one of those that paid for pods from YYZ to SXM a year in advance only to be rouged. But the lack of any refund for business class airfare difference was moot compared to the horrific service. I felt like I was in an airplane where children were playing flight attendants. Sloppy attire stroppy attitude no respect  ridiculous service. Lets not even talk about the antiquated offerings on the iPad. I like Air Canada proper but when booking future flights will avoid the ""red check mark"" indicating a flight operated by rouge. West Jet you have earned new clients for our yearly trips to Anguilla via SXM!"	0
"We recently flew from Honolulu to Vancouver on the red eye - not because we chose a red-eye but unless we flew to Alberta we did not have a choice! This was easily the worst flight my husband and I have been on. The same issues noted on previous reviews existed - cramped seats old shows/movies minimal cabin service inconsistent temperature aisle space must only barely meet standards reading lights not working (quote from an attendant ""working reading lights are not an airline safety requirement"" which was the response I got when I finally tracked down 2 attendants who initially both said they would check out why the lights weren't working or get me a mobile reading light and who never got back to me). We have decided to use our remaining Aeroplan miles on non- Air Rouge flights and then book with Westjet or US airlines for future trips. In addition to our recent negative experience another consideration to drop Air Canada was an Air Canada employee on a previous interaction said that no one likes Air Rouge but do not expect Air Canada to make any changes. Why would one stay with an airline who doesn't value their economy customers. AC would have to make some significant improvements to show that they actually care about customers to have me even consider flying with them in the future!"	0
"I flew from New York LaGuardia to Winnipeg via Toronto on December 22nd and return leg from Winnipeg to New York LaGuardia via Toronto was on January 9th. First check-in at LaGuardia was a nightmare long queues and no staff. Some of the customers complained to Air Canada agent and her reply was ""you should be happy for what you have"". Boarding was chaotic and plane departed 50 min late. On the way back boarding in Winnipeg took about 45 min because flight was full AC staff had to check in many bags into the hold of the aircraft. We departed 25 min late and arrived into Toronto 15 min behind the schedule. On the better note clean planes good legroom and awesome cabin crew who were attentive and kind to passengers. Checked in luggage arrived on the baggage belt within 15 min of our arrival."	0
Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable. In the event there is a problem and you need to contact someone be prepared to be put on hold for at least 1 hour. The last few times I have called 60 minutes was the quickest I was able speak to a human.	0
I booked 3 full fare flights to Cabo San Lucas on line at aircanada.com. Air Canada changed my direct flight from Cabo to Toronto twice prior to my departure. The first change had me stopping in Houston for a layover and then on to Toronto. Clearly not what I paid for. Shortly after that flight was changed routing me through San Francisco on a 'red eye' that had me arriving home Monday morning at 5.55am. I was to arrive home on Sunday evening but finally arrived home on Tuesday morning at 10am after they had handed me off to United who simply overbooked my flight. I contacted Air Canada for assistance from Mexico three times but they simply weren't interested. I truly wish there was real competition in the Canadian Airline industry so that I could avoid Air Canada in the future.	0
"DUS-MIA on A330-200. Unacceptable business class seat same as 6-8 years ago on LTU Airlines. They may call it ""economy plus"" but it has nothing to do with international long distance business class. IFE ok FA - only men - friendly but lack professional skills. Food below business standard just ""superior economy"" - same for drinks. Flight departed 40 mins late - no explanation given. Luggage delivery at MIA airport ok."	0
Düsseldorf to Vancouver. Our flight was delayed by 11 hours! Air Berlin did not offer passengers any compensation for the delay not even a meal coupon or a coffee. Onboard staff were also rude. They did not offer any explanation for delay when asked. The seats were relatively comfortable but the meals were below average. The overall quality is that of a typical budget airline. The worst customer service experience I have ever witnessed.	0
I'm sitting at the airport waiting for rouge 1849 to leave. It was supposed to leave at 6.20 its now 7.15 and everybody is milling around the Rouge desk waiting to see what will happen. Typical AC.	0
I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again. As I peruse the Internet wish I found this website earlier as I hear this is not the first time this has happened.	0
"Flight to Tampa from Toronto return in mid-February: 2 adults in ""premium rouge"" 6 adults (one over age 80) and 6 children in economy. Attendant in Premium was pleasant and helpful food okay but seats very uncomfortable. Economy was hot and stuffy attendant was surly ran out of food to purchase had to pay $60 for iPads for the children. Definitely not recommended for family travel."	0
YYZ-FRA-YYZ Business Class outbound on Lufthansa 747 code share which was a joy of comfort pleasant personable and attentive crew and with excellent catering and wines and return on Air Canada 777-200 with a sullen senior crew who greeted any request as a seemingly huge imposition and who disappeared at every opportunity when not dishing out the insipid catering. How this airline gets four stars and boasts about it is beyond me.	0
"I just returned from Honolulu through Vancouver to Calgary. The flight from Vancouver to Honolulu was okay. It was on time and I brought my iPad and had the app downloaded so I could connect to the entertainment system. Although the movie selection and TV selections were pretty old. I'm talking '80s '90s old and those are the ones outside ""vintage"" selections. Thankfully I found a couple of things to watch. The inflight crew were pretty good to Honolulu and the plane seemed clean. I was in the economy cabin on the way to Honolulu but decided to upgrade to Premium on the way back because I hate late night flights. Thank goodness I did. The return flight from Honolulu to Vancouver was delayed by four+ hours so at least I could go in the United lounge for a few hours. We left Honolulu at 2.30 am so there went my connection to Calgary. The crew in Premium were pleasant but young and inexperienced. One flight attendant was talking at full volume to her co-worker behind the curtain. A) It's the middle of the night and she should be quiet so people can sleep. B) There are things your customers shouldn't hear. Our compensation for the delay was food vouchers (hilarious because the Honolulu airport pretty much closes up after 9 pm - thankfully United's lounge stayed open late for those of us in Premium). The other compensation was a discount code for our next AC flight. Thankfully Air Canada rebooked me in Vancouver for my flight home to Calgary (although the agent made it seem like that was a big deal for them to do) and I wasn't too out of sorts. But from other comments it looks like the Honolulu flight out of Vancouver is delayed regularly. No more Rouge for me unless there are no other options."	0
I flew AC Rouge Feb 21st to Phoenix and return. We were 1.5 hours late taking off. They said it was because they were waiting for people to get through customs but why should we reward people for being late and punish the people who left on time to get through customs. Rouge's website states you only need to be there 90 minutes before your flight this is wrong you need to be there at least 2-2.5 hours before to get through customs. Arriving late in Phoenix they had us waiting at the wrong carrousel for our luggage and never did tell us. Onboard entertainment is non existent you have to bring your own. The TV and movies on the Rouge app are so old you cannot find anything to watch. On return flight we were 30 min late leaving. Arrival back in Toronto we waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage. I will say that there is one thing they do well. Their booking online their online reminders and online booking for your meals - (just remember you have to show the flight attendant your ticket that you have prepaid for your meal.	0
"We left Calgary on a Rouge flight to Vegas. It was a launch of the new Rouge ""service"" but it was anything but! There was not enough space to open my book so that I could partake in the only source of entertainment available to me on the flight. I could not download the Air Canada app in time to use my iPad and to rent one would be $10. Paying for all checked luggage coupled with no space entertainment or snacks made for the worst flight of my life!"	0
Yesterday I flew from London to Toronto on a Boeing 767 which is basically a lovely plane. My complaints about this flight which apply to every Air Canada flight I've taken in the past few years are principally about: a) terribly uncomfortable seats and b) the lousiest food anywhere in the air. a) Seat comfort. Who on earth designs a seat that is so short that it puts unbearable pressure on the middle of the back of one's thighs? And this wasn't a Rouge flight either but a mainline experience. Why do they torture us with seats that are so close together that our knees are grinding against the seat in front? I'm a very average sized person - 5'10 and 170 pounds - so there is no excuse why the seat should not be comfortable. And let's not even mention the fact that the available tilt is about 4 inches from front to back with zero lumbar support. b) Long ago back in the 70's when I was a university student I used to wonder why the cafeteria food was so terrible when Air Canada could server a very decent meal at 35000 feet in a pressurized aluminium tube. In those days I routinely asked if they had any leftover meals on transatlantic flights because the food was actually quite enjoyable. Not any more. It's just awful. Virtually inedible except when one is starving. And yesterday's flight was the very worst. Recently I had the opportunity to fly to from and around Central America on the Colombian airline Avianca. Although the aircraft themselves weren't new the in-flight experience and especially the food was exceptional. The difference between the food service on Air Canada and Avianca is night and day. Avianca has delicious food and interesting menus served with a smile. Air Canada has heated cardboard served reasonably efficiently but without any enthusiasm by flight attendants in dowdy uniforms. I'll be looking for alternative carriers to Air Canada from now on. Among North American airlines Delta gets my vote at the moment.	0
We flew Air Canada Rouge on a red eye from Honolulu to Vancouver on December 15th. We had booked the flight on Air Canada and were moved to Rouge without consultation. I have always maintained that while the staff on the ground were neither helpful nor happy the staff on the planes were brilliant. This was not true of Rouge. It was reminiscent of flying Ryanair but more expensive. The seats were unbelievable narrow with next to no leg room and I'm only 5'2. The elbow rests were small as well. The lights on each side of the aircraft were not turned off even though it was a red eye. We asked the staff who told us that the lights had to remain on as a safely concern because the reading lights weren't working. We weren't able to get a logical explanation as it seemed absurd that the reading lights would have anything to do with safety. At about 1 am the seatbelt light was turned on and an announcement was made to do up our seatbelts. The staff than walked down waking every covered up customer up to ensure their seatbelts were fastened. While I appreciate the safety factor I question the need to wake up every customer in the middle of the night. They offered water once during the flight. No other drinks were offered unless you wanted to pay. They also came around and offered food for pay; no snacks were offered. We're not sure what they did with all their time. We had spoken to an attendant on a previous flight who advised us that none of the existing crew members had been transferred to the Rouge line and that they were paid less. It showed in every aspect of this flight. We have been flying AC for years despite our but our ongoing problems getting off the ground because we maintained that once in the air Air Canada was excellent. This is not longer true. Our relationship ended on this flight. We will not be flying Air Canada again.	0
I flew Air Canada Rouge and was appalled at how cramped the seats are. They are narrow and so close to the seat in front I don't know how a tall person could even fit their legs in. Or travel for longer than the 3 hours I did. Not comfortable. The flight attendants were very friendly and competent.	0
"I was legitimately quite concerned flying AC-Rouge from OGG-YVR on an overnight flight this past February. Reviews of dirty planes incompetence and no seat room had me lamenting my end of my vacation (more so) than usual. I am 6""4 most planes have a lack of room for someone of my height. I had built Rouge to be this awful thing after all it's transport how bad could it be. Honestly it wasn't horrid. Granted I had this flight through points I would be furious if it was purchased full fare for business. But as a leisure airline overnight where most passengers are sleeping it did the trick. I did not have a premium seat or exit row. Yes it was tight but I fit in there ok seems to be a theme most flights I'm on have little to no leg room this felt no worse. The entertainment system was moot as it was overnight. Cabin was quiet well served (yes those outfits are idiotic) and I think they know it too. But overall it was not the horrid experience I would have expected."	0
"My wife was scheduled to fly from Montreal (YUL) to Toronto (YZZ) and then connecting to Minneapolis (MSP) on 01/04/15. Weather and de-icing delays kept passengers in the plane for over 3 hours waiting to depart from Montreal. She missed her connection in Toronto. Air Canada took no action during the 4 hour delay to rebook anyone who was going to miss their connecting flights. In the meantime AC's ""customer service"" number was continually busy. Stayed on hold for another 2 hours and finally got through to a booking agent. Got my wife rebooked for a later flight out of Toronto to MSP and wondered why this wasn't being handled internally by Air Canada. I notified my wife and she was able to check in and get to the gate in plenty of time for the later flight. I had a 3 hour drive to Minneapolis to pick her up. Just as I was getting on the interstate she text me saying that AC said there would be a slight delay but that it would be short. Halfway to Minneapolis I got another text saying that AC had cancelled the flight without explanation and were providing no assistance to stranded passengers. The gate agents were rude and simply told people they couldn't help them and that they would have to leave the gate area. What they failed to tell the stranded passengers was that they couldn't leave the secured area without assistance from AC or security. It was just by pure luck that my wife stopped an agent from another airline who explained that the passengers would need to be ""let out"" through a locked door so they could return to the ticketing area and start the entire process of booking a flight over again. Flights get delayed and cancelled that's just the way air travel has become. However Air Canada's total lack of regard for their passengers well being after a flight is cancelled was echoed by everyone flying Air Canada. The rudeness of the gate agents after the flight was cancelled and the empty promises of booking agents to assist stranded passengers was unparalleled. When the passengers were finally able to get to the ticketing area for Air Canada there were five queues with five functional computer terminals there were hundreds of people waiting in the five lines - but not a single Air Canada employee to be seen despite Air Canada's promises of assistance."	0
Berlin-Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf-Miami and Miami-Denver with American Airlines Jan 6 2012. We had a 5-month-old infant with us in Berlin the crew spoke little English so when we asked for 'deliver at the gate' tags for the baby's stroller they checked in the stroller as regular baggage all the way to Denver. In Miami we had a 6-hour layover and nothing to put the baby in. From Dusseldorf to Miami we didn't get a bassinet for the child as they supposedly were all booked. However when we walked around the plane it turned out that only one was in use. We ended up sitting in the last row by the restrooms where seats could not be reclined. We struggled to accommodate the baby for 10 hrs 40 mins. The crew was unpleasant when I asked for hot water to warm the baby's milk. I would not recommend Air Berlin.	0
"Toronto - Nassau Sept 23 2014 and Jan 14 2015. AC 1816. Nassau-Toronto Jan 28 2015 AC 1817. First point I'd like to make is that I'm a long-time dedicated Air Canada customer. I fly about once a month on business and 3-4 times a year on leisure. I'm 6'4"" - Rouge simply doesn't work. Rouge has managed to reach a new low in comfort. I don't need a lot of extras when I travel just a minimum amount of comfort. Really just boils down to a decent seat and some reasonable legroom. Whenever I travel now I avoid Rouge. Sorry Air Canada you've lost a dedicated customer."	0
"We flew from Vancouver to LA on Rouge. I had no idea what AC Rouge was. I was not particularly looking for a cheap flight just a way to get to Quito Ecuador in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately we have to fly back to Vancouver the same way. I will spend 2 days getting to Quito the next time rather than fly Rouge again. The kids attending to the flight were polite but obvious ""newbies"". The seats were absolutely not acceptable for normal weighted/heighted people. I am not sure my seat even had padding in it at all (I weigh 128 pounds) and my husband's knees were pressed hard against the seat in front of him (he is 6 feet tall). I always feel a little nauseous when travelling and there was no dispenser for air at all. Some of the seats were not aligned so when you put your feet under the seat in front of you you are sitting at an angle. We then switched to Avianca in LA to San Salvador Avianca again to Quito and Tame to Cuenca. What a world of difference! Air Canada needs to look at Avianca and Tame to see how to run an airline and treat their passengers! We will go out of our way to not fly Air Canada Rouge again and we will be telling all of our travelling friends to steer clear of Rouge and Air Canada altogether if at all possible."	0
Belfast - Montreal return. A rather unpleasant experience from start to finish. Best part of the trip was the flight to London only because that was on a codeshare flight with another airline. Air Canada flight from London to Halifax was on an old and dirty 767. Crew were rude and didn't have time for customers. Entertainment system dated and food was well below par of other airlines. Halifax to Montreal on a E175 and crew did bare minimum to pass their time onboard and again were just as unpleasant as the previous lot. My luggage got left in Halifax even though I had a 3 hour layover was reunited with my bags 2 days later with no apology offered when I returned to the airport to pick up lost luggage. Return flights were no better. Customer service and even customer interaction at the airport and on the aircraft isn't their strong point. I am heading back to Montreal in a few weeks time Air Canada are the cheapest but I have booked more expensive tickets via another airline so I can avoid flying Air Canada.	0
Our fight at YYZ was originally delayed 35 minutes. However when the plane never arrived it was bumped to a 1:25 minute delay. After everyone boarded the plane there was an additional 25 minute delay to upgrade the computer system with landing information about our destination. We were offered free $3 earphones for the inconvenience. I normally wouldn't write such a negative review based on one experience but this is after being silent for several similar past experiences.	0
Worst Airline I have flown! Flew AC1854 from Las Vegas to Toronto to connect with AC868 to London. Incoming arrived late into LAS. Incompetent gate staff could not facilitate a quick turnaround so late departure. Late arrival at Toronto and then a frozen cabin door meant that we missed out connecting flight to London. Had to wait 10 hours for next flight. On flight there was No inboard entertainment no food cabin crew barely out of school. What a farce! This was booked as a United Airlines flight. Won't make that mistake again.	0
I had the misfortune of getting placed on Rouge one year ago on a flight from Toronto to Kingston Jamaica and again this year from Orlando to Toronto. I would simply confirm what most passengers have said in these reviews. Cramped odd entertainment system and all around sub par travelling experience. Reading the reviews made me feel fortunate that my flights were under 4 hours. I could not imagine doing a transatlantic or transpacific flight in one of these planes. I plan to be travelling far more in the next few years and this experience has sent me scrambling to explore West Jet Porter or US airlines.	0
This is the worst experience I've had I understand it's New Years and its busy which is why I think they should be a little more organized. I will never fly Air Canada and would never recommend it. We came at 3 am to check in for our 6am flight yes we don't get served. Still waiting while they take the Toronto flight. We have been standing and still standing here to check in our luggage. They have no customer services. We have a big group with boxes and carts. We have been told to go in 3 different lines since 2 hrs ago yet still waiting. I would never fly this airline ever again.	0
B787 AC004 NRT to YVR Dec 22nd 2014 seat 3G. Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.	0
Flew Rouge Toronto to Phoenix 2 days ago. Knew it would be tight but they could put more padding on their seats. After a 5hour flight back was extremely sore. Agree with others the flight attendants appear to have little to no experience. Purchased a business class meal in economy and it took them over 2 hr to collect the tray and plates. My husband had no room on his fold down tray. And when we asked for it to he taken attendant refused. To top everything off because things were so tight we accidentally left our passport holder on the plane and didn't realize until next day. Fortunately got passports back but money was stolen. So try to speak to someone to report the theft and AC states they have no one on the ground in Phoenix as they have a third party. But they don't even have contact numbers to report the theft. Next time will fly either WestJet or Prter with JetBlue.	0
I have been flying with Air Canada for many years mostly southern destinations. My last flight last week was with Rouge. Small cramped and dirty. Cabin crew in cheap looking uniforms but service was adequate. My major beef is the seating. After 4.5 hours my legs hurt and my back ached. Is this the best Air Canada can do I hope not. Will look into other carriers that are willing to give me my moneys worth it will never be Rouge again.	0
Flew from Toronto to San Jose CR via Houston. Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.	0
Service has deteriorated every year in the last 5 years. The staff at the airport representing Air Canada treat customers with disdain and do nothing to communicate delays etc. We are always left to guess about delays since no announcements are made. There is absolutely no courtesy shown towards regular customers. We are treated in a way that shows that our business is not valued at all. I only fly Air Canada because I have no choice where I live. I am happy WestJet will finally be providing service out of my local airport. At least then I will be able to experience some courtesy and satisfaction when I have to fly anywhere.	0
Flew between Toronto and Samana Dominican Republic - Feb 7-14/15. Yes the seats are extremely cramped and the armrest between my partner and I wouldn't stay up (to allow us a bit of extra room). Heaven forbid the person in front of you reclines. The least they could do is give you a free sandwich on flights over 3.5 hours. Brought my own iPad with ACRouge app downloaded but the content was severely lacking (old old TV shows and movies). But the service was attentive and friendly (both at check-in and on-board) and the flight was on time both ways. Could have been worse.	0
"Toronto to Santa Clara Cuba Feb 20 back Feb 27 2015. Airbus 319. Same trip last year but in B767. That was comfortable compared to this. Okay its the discount airline division of Air Canada. But its still 'Air Canada"". On time for both flights. We take our seats in Toronto (BC16) and the folding tray I use is down on the left side. I have to use my arm to stop things from sliding off. Leg room is at its limits. I'm a small guy. No entertainment unless you rent it or carry your own on with you. I listen to audio books I'm good to go. Return trip (AB27) Where did the leg room go. I must have got rid of that tension and gained height or leg length. Sitting squarely in my seat (window) and my knees were at the seat in front of me. The guy in front of me was getting in his seat and the backrest side against the bulkhead looked like it was going to twist off and break from the seat. Each time he moved in his seat which was a lot because he also was uncomfortable. I was getting kicked in the knee with the aluminium crossbar from his seat. From my chest to his seat back was 13-14 inches. Doing some reading from the en-route Magazine and the fleet seating setup. Not quite the vacation memory I would have liked to have had this year Air Canada. My luggage didn't fly home to BC with me to top it all off."	0
From start to finish my experience of Air Canada was one I don't want to repeat unfortunately. From them changing planes and not notifying me so the exit row seat I'd paid for to accommodate my 6ft 5 son was no longer available to the poor quality food on the plane (the vegetarian tea time snack consisted of a banana plum and Satsuma) and the functional but not welcoming staff and the very narrow seat on the 787 all in all a very disappointing experience. The only plus points I could find were the online check in and bag drop and the entertainment system on the 787.I would best describe Air Canada as a transatlantic budget airline but maybe I've been spoilt by travelling with far superior airlines in economy class in the past.	0
We flew Rouge on Dec 31st to Honolulu and were not impressed. We had originally booked this flight with Air Canada and to our surprise it was changed to Rouge. We thought okay we'll give them a try. The flight crew was very inexperienced which was understandable but they didn't even seem to try to make the passengers feel comfortable. Once we were in the air and they passed through the cabin once we didn't see them again until just before landing. They were slow in loading in the plane in Vancouver and in Honolulu they didn't seem to have clue as to what they were doing. The service on the return trip was even worse than the flight over. I saw several comments about how cold the plane were and how uncomfortable the seats were. We had the premium economy which were the seats with extra leg room and really not much of a bargain but much better than what economy looked like. In the future I'll look for something else than Rouge. I think this is bad idea from Air Canada. WestJet crams their passengers in the seats but at least comes by to see how their doing. Rouge doesn't have the low cost model with the caring attitude.	0
Flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Cancun 4 hour flight that's about all you can take sitting in that little seat the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced if the seat in front of you reclines it feels even worse. The seats are small no inflight entertainment if want you can rent an Ipad which is pre loaded with movies the plane we were on was dated and old. One wash room was out of order. Drinks of water and pop served once during flight. Flight attendants are not very friendly you feel like your bothering them if your asking for a drink of water. Cash call for the airline and no consideration for the people who can only afford economy class tickets. I will never fly Rouge again.	0
Travelled on flight AC033 Vancouver to Sydney on October 31. Again staff were rude and unhelpful. Inflight entertainment did not work in our row of seats for entire flight - 16 hours is a long time to listen to aircraft noise and read a book. Seat belt sign again used to excess and it did mean that tea and coffee were never served as no hot beverages when seat belt sign is on. Staff kept one toilet for their own use by claiming it was 'out of order'. One member of staff was extremely rude and loud actually shouting instructions at passengers. Would not fly internationally with Air Canada again.	0
We recently tried to book a flight from Halifax to Orlando with Air Canada. Unfortunately all suitable flights were showing Rouge as the operator. We had recently had a very bad experience with Rouge due to the minimal seat space and no padding in the seats. We refused to even consider a Rouge seat. We seriously considered driving to Orlando until CAA found us direct flights with WestJet. Much more attractive than Air Canada.	0
Berlin – Miami. Our flight was diverted to Ft. Myers instead of Miami due to weather. Problem was in Ft. Myers the airline kept us on the tarmac for 3 hrs giving us various stories. After we de-boarded a representative from the airline said they would refund the cost of the rental car for those who didn't want to wait for busses to Miami. After 2 months of exchanging emails they declined to refund the money.	0
Delayed Vancouver to Dusseldorf 13 hrs with no compensation. Had confirmed seats by paying extra for Top Bonus but seat selection was not honoured. Re-routed with a 9 hr delay. No toilet tissue in the washroom after the first 3 hrs. Replaced slowly and continued to be a problem throughout the flight. Sat in row 28. Had to ask for beverage service which seemed to be a hassle for flight attendants.	0
"We were originally going to book our vacation package (6 adults 4 kids) through WestJet because Air Canada Vacations did not have a package to the Marina El Cid. The travel agent offered us the option to book our flights with Air Canada then book transfer and hotel separately. We were very happy to choose that option since Air Canada was recommended as ""the best"". On Feb 18th we flew to Cancun on Air Canada Rouge and will never fly Rouge again. We had a 4.5 hr delay due to mechanical issues. We arrived at the airport at 5.30 am for our 8.30 flight. Between 6.43 am and 7.42 am the departure time changed 4 times. (11.00 12.00 13.30 and finally 13.00). We rec'd a $10.00 food voucher per person which we all know does not get you much in an airport. A sandwich and a drink was min $12.00. Not long after take off my sister in law went to the bathroom and came back to report that it smelt. The inflight entertainment system is a joke. The leg room is so cramped. We did receive a promo code for a discount on a future booking no idea how much of a discount but will probably never use it as it seems that all flights to sun destinations are with Rouge so disappointing. Hopefully when we are ready to book our Feb 2016 family vacation (10-12 people) Rouge will be gone and Air Canada Vacations will be a contender again."	0
Recently returned from Honolulu to Toronto. Never heard of Rouge before and never want to hear of it again. You would think on an 8.5+ hour international flight that entertainment and meals would be a given without having to purchase. We were not aware there wouldn't be food. We are not big people but have never been so uncomfortable on a flight. Seats were far too close and didn't seem to have any padding. Plane also appeared quite dirty. The staff were neither friendly or unfriendly just seemed to be doing a job (probably hoping they would soon be transferred to the better planes!).	0
CPH-TXL return. Boarding was a mess with everyone rushing onboard. CPH-TXL slept through the flight. TXL-CPH flight I wanted to have a second drink and I stopped and asked the stewardess for a cup of water and was told to wait. She walked pass again without stopping back to the gallery. I pressed the call button and when the same stewardess came she refused to serve me as we were landing soon.	0
Why would Air Canada put Rouge planes on flights to Phoenix and San Diego when they have almost a monopoly of these flights and always full. Just to give less service. Had booked premium rouge and pre-chose seats. On return they switched my seats so my wife and I were now not together. This is taking care of customers. Avoid Rouge whenever it's possible. I will now fly Alitalia to Italy if AC keeps these old planes on the route.	0
Seven hour delay and had to camp out in Maui airport that had no services. Filthy aircraft interior small cramped seats only food was what was left on the plane (sushi for breakfast) from the previous trip from Vancouver. Young inexperienced flight attendants inadequate in air entertainment with old movies and TV series no one has ever heard of if you didn't have an iPad and wanted to rent one there aren't enough for the plane no duty free on international flight. Hard to believe that Rouge was created to compete with the likes of Westjet and they missed the mark big time. All the captive popular destinations will be populated with Rouge so the service we are all used to with Air Canada will be gone. I find it hard to believe I'd say that I'd rather fly United now but it looks that way.	0
"I was flying Ft. Lauderdale to Toronto. I paid a full fare economy ticket and paid for a ""priority seat"". I want to know what is so priority about it as they make you board the flight last as it is in the front of the plane. All other airlines give you priority access when you pay extra for your seat assignment. Would have been better off picking row 30 for free."	0
Economy flight to London on the Dreamliner was the worst ever. To leave at 11.50 pm boarded at 12.One hour delay while computer is programmed for Heathrow then 30 minute delay because of shift change. New seat cut off circulation in the back of my legs and I had the sensation of being crammed in to make more money. The entertainment centre controls are in the arm rest right where one would put their elbow. All night the passenger beside me was turning on and off his and my system and overhead lights. If I put my elbow on the arm rest I would do the same to the passenger beside me. Try sitting for 8 hours with no place to put your arms and light flashing on and off as you tried to sleep. Needless to say there was no baggage for my connecting flight to Lisbon. Don't fly the Dreamliner.	0
SFO to Dusseldorf a 10hr nightmare. No leg room overcrowded plane rude staff no choice of entertainment seats very hard with little cushion. Not significantly cheaper than the major airlines when you consider a sore back is assured after arrival.	0
We flew home from Los Angeles to Vancouver yesterday and unfortunately had to fly with Air Canada rouge. This was the worst flight I have experienced! There were only three flight attendants for the entire Airbus and no one was over 24 years old! Talk about inexperience! Only one attendant was serving beverages to the economy section and it took a painful two hours to complete! The seats were very uncomfortable and we were unable to get our knees straight in front of us. The back of the seats had no support which made for the most uncomfortable three hour flight! Never again will we use the services of Air Canada.	0
Flew Vancouver/Honolulu and back on A/C Rouge Jan/Feb 2015. First thing I noticed after boarding was how dirty the aircraft was looked like it wasn't groomed in weeks. Seats were cramped very little cushioning cabin was extremely cold during flight didn't provide blankets or pillows. Will never fly Rouge again I'll spend the extra $$$ and fly with a real airline next time I head to Hawaii.	0
"My husband and I flew Vancouver to Las Vegas mid Nov/14. We have done this route many times but this time it was operated by ""Rouge"". The most uncomfortable flight we have ever experienced. We will never fly Rouge again."	0
Dusseldorf to Vancouver and used Air Berlin because they have a non stop flight. Never have I been on an airline that has such abusive people and a system generated to swindle money out of passengers because of bags. They were rude and knew that when you get to the counter you have no choice but to accept any tactics they use to get money out of you for bags. They will try to charge you 150 Euros for the hand pieces you are carrying which are not overweight and in regulation size. There were at least 15 to 20 passengers who were experiencing the same thing. It was not just one employee who was doing this the passengers realized and were talking about it that employees of AirBerlin had an organized system of telephoning each other to pinpoint passengers that they could charge more from the check in counter to the cashier to the gate check in. Three people on the counter at the gate who were picked out for extra charges for hand pieces were yelling at them for not providing a receipt.	0
Passenger cabin was ok legroom was enough for a small person. Cabin crew especially female FA's were not friendly and seemed irritated and annoyed. Service was not worth the price.	0
"What an embarrassment for Air Canada. I have spent the last 3 or 4 years defending the ""new"" Air Canada for the quality and safety of travel with them (you know the drill about their ""award winning"" status). After my family's Rouge experience I am back at square 0. Let me count off the ways Rouge made us see red on our recent trip to Hawaii: 1) highly punishing and inefficient boarding process both in Vancouver and in Honolulu 2) primitive entertainment services 3) a 1980s vintage and obsolete B-767 where essential functions like lighting to read by didn't work 4) hours of discomfort in seats that hinted at promiscuity (that's how close they are to each other front to back and side to side) 5) a Rouge crew that was decidedly green (we figure that this must be a training ground for new Air Canada staff and the perky uniform is decidedly weird). So my family's take is: avoid AC Rouge and go WestJet or take a US carrier even if it costs more."	0
We got rouged too. What a terrible airline. First off no in-flight entertainment. Unless you knew that prior and downloaded the AirCanadaRouge App to your iPad. If you have $10 you can rent an iPad? The only entertainment you get is watching other passengers painfully adjust in their seats. Even less legroom than any other plane! Are you hot? Well there aren't any personal air vents. Hope you ate before you got on board or brought your own snack because you won't be getting a crumb from this airline. Maybe they should have saved money by not buying fedoras for the airline crew. Oh and all the airline attendants look like 19 yr old kids.	0
Toronto to London - I booked 3 seats and had them pre-assigned so we could all sit together. This was confirmed and the seats allocated. When I arrived at the plane the crew had split our seats up and would not change other seating so we could sit together. My 4 year old was initially sat alone next to a stranger. The result was that I could not go to the bathroom with my son without leaving my baby. I could not change my baby without leaving my son alone - my wife was 30 odd rows away. The stewardesses would not help us get food from bags (which were all with my wife because we were meant to be sat together). When I complained through customer relations I was told that it is always challenging travelling with children. They let us down at every stage of our journey and ruined our trip home.	0
"A lot of anticipation on flying the AC Dreamliner - a large spacious quiet aircraft that just eases the flight hours away - not - Air Canada decided to put in very small aisles tiny uncomfortable seats and an entertainment system that doesn't tilt. I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up! Come on AC adding a slow-release toilet seat would cost you nothing!"	0
Air Berlin changed our return flight for our honeymoon a few weeks beforehand so that we would miss our connection in Dusseldorf. Their only attempt to reconcile was to refund the ticket in full or give us 80 Euro off a hotel in Dusseldorf so we could catch a connection the next day. The former would cancel our honeymoon in its entirety and the latter would not cover the cost of a hotel at such last minute notice. There was absolutely no consideration or concern on their part. They seemed totally indifferent to the entire issue.	0
Feb 14 Vancouver to Honolulu flight 7 hours delayed. This flight has run late most days over the past 2 months. Service on board poor - traveller requesting full can of Coke was denied and got a lecture from attendant that she still had several passengers to serve. Time to switch to Westjet.	0
"Vancouver to Honolulu - The AC was ""entire cabin"" type (no small control like regular planes) and we had to keep our coats on for the full trip both ways because of cold drafts. The Flight Attendants quietly agreed."	0
"Problem with Air Canada was that Air NZ was our main carrier and they use Air Canada for the YYZ/LA and LA/YYZ leg at end. What a contrast - a first class carrier and a no frills one. All Air NZ flights treated passengers as if they were valued and always gave them something (even a 75 min flight got wine and cheese). A 5hr one with AC got you a cup of lukewarm coffee. ANZ staff chatted and joked with customers. Air Canada's just went through the motions. It really felt like a ""bus run"". It was was so disappointing to see how far Canada's national carrier has sunk. I will avoid them at all costs in the future - too bad ANZ doesn't fly everywhere from Canada."	0
"I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500."	0
JFK-TXL-VIE Round Trip. The Transatlantic portion of the flight was much worse than the Intra-Europe portion. The planes used for transatlantic are older and very uncomfortable compared to Intra-Europe planes which were new and had more legroom! On the way to Europe our flight departed late and our bags did not make the connection to VIE. Ok so this happens from time to time we'll probably have our bags the next day. Nope airline was not forthcoming with any info at all. I had to call to get any status. Next day found out that 2 of 3 bags had arrived but could not get them to deliver those until 3rd was located. Then we find out my 3rd bag had a lovely time visiting friends in Venice (VCE). After 2 1/2 days and 20 calls later our luggage finally arrived.	0
Berlin-Miami. What a nightmare. The plane was about 3 hrs 40 mins late with no apology no information. I was in Business class. The crew was the rudest incompetent I have experienced in my 35 yrs of flying. We arrived in Miami priority bags came off last for the last insult!	0
I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time last week (YYZ to Honolulu) - it was the worst flight I have ever taken and I fly frequently. The seats were extremely small/cramped and at 6'1 I had nowhere near enough room. I was surprised how many seats they crammed onto an old 767. The staff were not very helpful or courteous and with no seatback display system we had to use our own device to access entertainment via wifi. Most of the people seated around me didn't realize that you needed to download the Air Canada Rouge app beforehand and they were out of luck (or had to rent one of their tablets). I was able to use my phone to connect but there was no wifi access for the first hour of the flight and it was intermittent at best afterwards with frequent dropouts and long waits for reconnections. The tablet concept does not work. I am disappointed that AC has transitioned/downgraded many of their holiday destinations to Rouge service and will be looking to alternatives i.e. West jet. I will never fly AC Rouge again.	0
I flew 3 times with AC Rouge in 2014. Twice to the Dominican Republic and once to Rome from Montreal. Not a very good experience very tight seating no entertainment and the plane to Rome was an old Boeing 767 that needed overhauling. Service was mediocre and their outfits looked ridicules. From now on I will try to avoid AC Rouge.	0
A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls. We were fortunate that we were able to complete our journey that day. I am not certain all our fellow abandoned passengers were so lucky. I am afraid I could never trust Air Canada in the future.	0
Today I was on a connecting flight with Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver through Toronto. The flight to Toronto was delayed and I asked whether I would be able to make the connection which I was assured I would. On landing in Toronto I made it to my connecting gate 20 minutes before takeoff and they had already removed me from the flight. Colleagues who arrived at the gate behind me were not removed from the flight. The explanation from customer service was that they were in business class and I was flying economy. Needless to say the flight I was on and made the connection to was now full as was the next flight making me late for a meeting this evening.	0
Air Berlin from Dortmund to Barcelona via Palma. Plane was late arriving in Dortmund and more delayed leaving for Palma. Our AB connection did not wait in Palma so we were re booked onto another flight. Crew unfriendly and did not care that many passengers missed their flights. Our flights from check-in in Dortmund to Barcelona took 9 hrs 45 mins. Air Berlin used to be very good now they are people carriers who simply do not care.	0
Air Canada rouge is the worst airline I have ever flown. Not only have they crammed in extra rows of seats ensuring the most cramped flight experience they still let the seats recline which puts the seat in front of you in your face. I did not have a choice in airlines as I redeemed aeroplan miles and spent the same amount as if I had flown on AC but got stuck on rouge. The fact that Air Canada is switching sun and fun destinations to Rouge has made the decision to switch to Westjet an easy one. At least the loyalty miles (Westjet dollars) will actually get me on a Westjet plane!	0
I traveled in economy from Paris to Montreal in October 2014. The overall experience was not too bad but the main negative point is the very poor quality of the food onboard. It is impossible to eat what they serve. Better to take your own food if you travel with Air Canada.	0
CPH-DUS one way. A very bad experience. Check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer. Excess baggage 10 euro per kilo. On board you have to pay for everything and very expensive. Plane was old and not very clean. Legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable. And the most important: crew very rude and not smiling.	0
"ZRH-TXL-OSL trip on Air Berlin. Arrived to Zurich on AA. Due to the volcanic ash cloud my morning flight to Berlin got cancelled. No one showed up by the gate to explain what was happening so all passengers had to run back to the check in counter only to be redirected to the Air Berlin service desk. After waiting in line for about 30 minutes was told that I can be re-booked either to a 7pm flight this same day or following morning although they could not assure me that the flight would actually depart. No accommodation food voucher refund of the unused portion of the ticket or getting me on one of SAS flights directly to Oslo or Copenhagen were offered because in words of the airline rep ""It's not our fault."" I ended up buying a train ticket to a friend in Germany renting a car and driving to Oslo myself."	0
"Flew from Vancouver to Maui and back. We booked on points and quite frankly I had no idea what Rouge was before we even boarded the plane. Biggest complaint was about lack of in-flight entertainment. As a parent with two younger kids in-flight movies are a lifesaver. I was floored to see that missing. Did we have other options - yes. We had our own ipad books etc. What was galling was to be told ""you can access movies from your ipad but only if you have the app downloaded first"". Of course that is useless advice once in the air so guess what? We have iPads for rent for $10. It's the nickel-and-diming on every last thing possible that drives me nuts. The plane was huge and full and yes seats are cramped. I am 5'8 and did okay my husband though at 6'4 it was an agonizing trip particularly the red-eye on the way back. Finally the crew. They all looked very young and the inexperience showed. A young Dad wasn't seated with his wife infant and toddler and was told to ""ask around to see if someone will switch"". He said ""I was told you would help me with that"" to which the response was ""there will be lots of people who'll want to switch if you ask around."" Not sure if she ever did lend assistance. There are other nitpicky things (flight was more than an hour late leaving Maui) etc. Nothing was disastrous but all the little annoyances add up. I am officially done. To be charged for every little thing plus have poor service and the prices aren't even that much better? No thanks I'm out!"	0
"Terrible aircraft equipment track record. Both my flight from Honolulu to Vancouver went mechanical and eventually cancelled after 7 hours of indecisiveness from the Air Rouge crew and now last night from Vancouver to Honolulu we took off and had to turn back around because of mechanical problems again and the flight was cancelled. The ""Premium rouge"" seats are Business class prices but no way Business class seats. What a downgrade from Air Canada's lay flat Business class seats. I am contemplating flying economy on Westjet."	0
I have travelled with Air Canada in the past and did not hesitate to book a flight with Rouge thinking that it would be a similar experience. I was so wrong! I travelled from Toronto to Phoenix. While waiting at the gate the staff were so disorganized they were not able to board the passengers in a timely fashion. There were 5 boarding groups. They called the first second and third in rapid succession so there were very long lines that were taking very long time to process. Once on the plane there was not adequate space for my carry on. I was told I had to check it. Since I have medications in the bag that I cannot be without I refused to check the bag. The stewardess asked me to remove the medication from my bag and keep it in my purse or under my seat. It would have been embarrassing! In order to remedy this situation in the future perhaps Rouge should not allow people to place backpacks and smaller items that can fit under the seat in the overhead bins so more room would be available for carry on bags. Then place coats and jackets in the bins after the bags are in place. The plane was so full that I had to sit on my winter coat for the entire 4 hour flight as there was not even a space for my coat. Not too comfortable. I paid the same price or more than my last Air Canada flight Toronto to Phoenix so Rouge is not even offering a more economical flight. More than likely more profit for the airline less comfort for the passenger.	0
"I've flown AC before but luckily with folks that work with the airline thus a very favorable fare (tax only). Our most recent trip to Europe included a one-way flight from YVR to LAX for a 3-day layover for some fun in the sun. We asked to be moved up to an earlier flight as we were meeting some friends in LA so I contacted AC reservations three times and got three different stories. I decided to go to the airport the day off early and asked where I could change my flight. This is where the unfriendly cold staff interactions begin. When I asked where I could go to change my booking the lady proceeded to hold up a finger telling me to pause while she scrutinized carry on bag sizes for passengers then when she ""had a moment"" pointed in the general direction of a service desk and said ""there!"". A short walk and 10 minute wait in the line led me to another miserable lady who told me I should be in the international terminal since I'm flying to LA but in this case ""she'd make an exception"". I proceeded to ask her if there were two different operating companies for domestic versus US flights knowing the answer. The lady gave a short and concise ""no"" response and proceeded to tap away at her computer for minutes without looking up or saying a word. Her next words were to give me the outrageous ""change fee"" costs which I paid to get the ordeal over with. When I asked about the policy change she said didn't give any explanation other than ""that's the way it is now."" Inflight the staff were even worse. We flew on a ""Rouge"" flight which I guess is their budget full-staffed sub. Long story short the worst airline I've flown! From their front-end service staff to in-flight crew all around miserable people. I'm never flying with them again. Lets put it this way my wife and I were almost stuck in Europe during the Lufthansa strike and we feared having to travel on an Air Canada flight back home."	0
"Our supposed 7 days in Ireland turned into 5 due to the inept staff at Air Canada. Connection was late and missed our direct flight to Dublin which was oversold for the next night - after 7 hours in Toronto the next day we then flew to Frankfurt for another 7 hour layover before finally reaching Dublin 2 days late. The Tampa-Toronto flight was held on the tarmac in Toronto 20 minutes as there was no gate crew and the flight attendants did not allow connecting passengers off the plane first then customs closed. Air Canada booking agents ""forgot"" to rebook my husband and I on the direct flight resulting in the Frankfurt layover - inept. Return - same issue missed our connection in Toronto to Tampa had to fly 4 hours later to Orlando at midnight and rent a car to drive home. Will never fly Air Canada again!"	0
Will go back to LH for my next domestic flights in Germany. Very uncomfortable seating on old looking B737 HAM-MUC. Flight full and was very annoyed when gate agent decided my carry-on suitcase was too big to go onboard but had to be gate checked. Bag is/was well within size limitations but I was being penalised for boarding as one of the last passengers as previous passengers were allowed to carry 2 bags on board. Was very inconvenient to carry laptop travel documents and other valuables as lose items while carry-on was gate checked. Should have done what majority of late boarding passengers did and simply ignore the tag and take the bag/suitcase on board.	0
"Flew on an early morning flight from YVR to LAX. As soon as I boarded the plane I was a little taken aback at how many seats there were (and I travel a lot and have seen a lot of aircraft). I sat in 51F which is right at the back of the plane (as in last row). It's a 3 seater row (with adjustable arm rests) so I had plenty of space to move around freely. However any other of the seating and it would be a very tight fit. I'm a larger guy so I tend to get the aisle seat but I found that the rest of the craft would've been very cramped for my size. Just enough leg room I'm 5""9 and I was barely touching the seat in front of me. Any taller and it would be painful."	0
Just flew on Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Cancun and back. I must admit after seeing these reviews I was a little nervous. But I thought I would give them a chance especially since it was our honeymoon. On the flight down we were coming from Thunder Bay to meet the connection in Toronto. When checking in in Thunder Bay we were told we would be getting our seats numbers when we get to the gate. I later realized that this was a fancy way of saying the plane was overbooked and we were chosen to be bumped. However we were able to get on the flight and my wife and I were able to sit together. On the flight down the staff were very cheery and in a good mood. After this first flight I thought I might be giving them a good review. The seats are a little cramped but it was not too bad for four hours. The way back was pretty bad. So when we check-in in Cancun the agent said that the plane was overbooked and asking us if we would volunteer to spend the night. My wife and I both had commitments back home so we said no. So they gave us our tickets and once again told us we would get our seat numbers at the gate. Translation: If people show up you are still getting bumped. We both got on the flight but were unable to even sit anywhere close to each other. We asked if could be switched but we were told no. Ironically the lady was beside was by herself too so they were just too lazy to figure it out. The staff on the way back seemed very miserable. My wife told me she had to flag down someone to order food even though she had her credit card out ready to pay. And they didn't even give her a declaration card. Thankfully in Canada you can fill one out for the entire family. While I admit that the entertainment system is very innovative it did crash from time to time. So make sure you have some back up entertainment on your devices. The fact that we were almost bumped on our honeymoon is very discouraging. I would say stick to WestJet Sunwing or Air Transat. I can't wait until Porter starts doing tropical destinations. However I would not recommend Rouge unless you are prepared to be bumped and you don't mind the cramped space.	0
"I've had concerns with AC's quality for some years but a recent flight to Phoenix on AC Rouge finally sealed its fate as far as I am concerned. I am 6'4"" tall 280 pounds. How I got into the seat I will never know. The poor person in front of me had my knees in their back and simply wasn't able to recline their seat. I'm used to AC staff being frumpy with a 'can't be bothered' attitude but this flight hit a new low. Rude abrupt ignoring requests dealing sandwiches like cards from a deck I could go on. The final humiliation was that after a 4.5 hour flight my legs were totally numb (as was my rear). It took three passengers and an AC staff member to heave me out of the seat and support me while the circulation returned. I changed to another airline for the return flight. I will never fly AC again. I will pay extra for another airline take a stop over change my route but never again AC. I am ashamed to be Canadian with you as the national airline."	0
"Avoid Air Canada AC875 and other flights to/from Europe if you are taller than 5' 9"" and don't want to harm your knees and suffer from leg cramps after your flight. There is absolutely no space between your knees and the seat in front of you. When the person in front of you reclines you will get trapped in your seat. Worst of all the staff will treat you as the problem for being too tall. I know that I will never fly them again. Lufthansa and Air France offer much better alternatives. I have flown to Europe with these carriers and had more leg room with better meals as an added bonus."	0
AC 1173 to Vancouver on October 12 and returned to Toronto on AC 152 October 19. It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job. Appropriate training and supervision is definitely in order.	0
I find Air Canada Rouge airplanes from Toronto-Phoenix and return to be very cramped. As well the entertainment system is in my opinion very poor. The selection for those who have their own iPad is less than for those who rent an Air Canada Rouge iPad. I really wish that there was an option to fly this route at least once a week with the main airline Air Canada.	0
"It's Canada's answer to Europe's Ryanair. They're making a few extra bucks by cramming more very uncomfortable seats onto an Airbus 319. The ""entertainment"" streaming which replaces the usual video screens is a joke unless you enjoy watching endless commercials and the lamest movies on the market. My biggest problem is that Air Canada on certain routes no longer gives you a choice between a regular flight and ""budget"" Rouge. Fortunately we were flying Vancouver to Palm Springs ( only 2.5 - 3 hours). Pity the fools who are on long haul Rouge flights. I'd be tearing my hair out! The high school kids who were pretending to be flight attendants were enthusiastic and doing their best but as mentioned in another comment are they prepared for an emergency situation."	0
We flew YYZ to Phoenix (5 hour flight) and I was in constant pain from the seats. While waiting for bags at the destination (which took 90 minutes) most of the passengers we talked to said the same thing - never again Rouge. Air Canada has embarked on a strange experiment to find out how much people will pay to avoid extreme inconvenience and physical distress.	0
Toronto to Phoenix Dec 13th 2014 AC1849. Phoenix to Toronto Jan 10th 2015 AC1848. There is simply no leg room in economy for an average height adult. It was incredibly uncomfortable for the duration of the flight. Will have to find an alternative airline.	0
I was very disappointed with the airline. On my way to the airport I got a text saying my connecting flight was cancelled and they had to re-route us. I was to arrive at my destination at 0930 in the morning and didn't get there until 5 in the evening. I had a 2 hour wait in one airport and a 3 hour wait in another. This was not acceptable to me as I was travelling with my husband who is a dialysis patient and had meds with him that had to be kept cold also my 75 year old mother who has problems walking. Not once did we get an apology or even a food voucher to eat. Thankfully we were only travelling from Deer Lake to Toronto - usually a 2.5 hour flight but took us 11 hours. Very disappointed.	0
Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.	0
DUS-PUJ-DUS. The on time schedule was ok but I have never experienced such an unfriendly and unprofessional cabin crew with really poor language skills! Aas I was about to change the position of overhead luggage to get the lighter one in the less strong compartment I was told to remove it immediately. Even after explanation the answer was she would not care as this compartment was not for me. When requesting a new blanket as the one on our seats were obviously already used the same person told us that this was not her job the cleaners should have fixed this but if we want new ones we should get up and look for it ourselves.	0
This is one of the worst airlines that I have flown. Maybe they should spend as much time taking courses in courtesy as they do on those ridiculous outfits. I boarded the plane and had to put my ticket into my pocket because I had a full hot coffee in my one hand and a very heavy fragile bag in the other hand. Upon entering the plane I already knew my seat number in my head. The attendant demanded to know what seat I was in. I told her and kept moving. She then got belligerent with me and demanded to see my ticket. I told her that I don't have a third hand and my ticket was put away. She jumped in front of me to keep me from walking forward and demanded yet again to see my ticket. I have flown this airline maybe 5-6 times now and all of their flight attendants are rude. The physical plane was fine the flying was fine the snacks were fine but the attendants - not fine.	0
I'm a frequent flyer with lifetime status and fly about 150k a year. This was my first and last rouge flight. Economy seating was terrible. There's absolutely no room. When comparing economy seating and space on rouge to other airlines other airlines' economy seating is huge. I thought sardines had it bad but then again the sardines are typically dead before being canned. I now know what a sardine feels like. I'll be taking another airline. To Air Canada bring back normal service!	0
Arrived at Halifax Airport on Saturday morning 04.30 for our family trip to Cancun. Check in was slow with only one attendant taking her time. After scanning our passports the Air Canada attendant told us that because my husband and son has the same first names it causes problems for their system. She was very rude about the whole situation! Arrived in Toronto where the attendants were more professional and friendly. Inflight was uncomfortable and tight which can be expected with economy class. Overall flights were OK but we will avoid flying Air Canada again.	0
I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying! If Economy is well priced on Air Canada it may be worth it but not Business Class.	0
Myself and my wife along with a 3 year old we took a flight from Toronto - Vancouver. Staff were very rude at check-in at the boarding gate as well as on the flight itself. I requested a pillow and a blanket for my son who was very sleepy as we had transited from UK the air crew rudely said to me that we have to pay for it I didn't mind paying but it is something unheard of. I travel so often but never asked to pay for these things even in the cheapest airlines in Europe like Ryanair EasyJet etc. I will never recommend Air Canada to anyone and will never fly with them again in the future. This doesn't seem like a star alliance to me. Worst by all means.	0
Stockholm - Berlin - Miami - Atlanta. Weather delays in Atlanta caused me to be stranded in Miami for 4 days. Knowing the forecast I asked representatives in Stockholm and Berlin if I would make it to my final destination. All representatives refused to look up flight or airport information causing me to be stranded in Miami instead of getting on a later flight out of Stockholm. Furthermore the flight in Berlin was delayed 3.5 hours. Completely unpleasant flight experience. I will not fly with Air Berlin again. Flight was satisfactory.	0
I have travelled AC Rouge a few times in Premium and this was my first in economy and have to say I truly do not like the AC Rouge concept at all. They have taken all the fun away from travelling on vacation and cheapened the Air Canada brand considerably. I am an elite status AC member and really struggling with continuing to give Air Canada any more of my business because of this. The service is mediocre at best and the whole ipad concept does not work. The movies are old and it is too awkward to deal with. Overall a truly unappealing experience.	0
If I had to fly Rouge Economy always I would quit travelling. I am a regular BC Client and on short notice had to fly Rouge. All they are doing with this service is making me fly other airlines. I am forced to fly Rouge Premium to Costa Rica Feb. 23rd and purposely choose American Airlines with a Layover in Miami of 3 hours for the trip home as I prefer their business class.	0
"Flew back from Paris to Toronto 4 Oct does Air Canada actually have anybody checking ""hand luggage"" an amazing amount hand luggage seen going onboard aircraft. By the time we were boarded all the luggage bins were full of large suitcases. This has happened a number of times now. Tired of struggling to load our small bags and will now try another airline that actually enforces hand baggage size. Would help if Air Canada thought about all customers rather than ignoring an obvious problem."	0
"B777-300 Vancouver-London Heathrow 2 Sep 2014. The new business class seat is terrible - narrow short ridiculously sized and shaped. It's okay as a seat but I paid for a good night's sleep. Forget it! I'm 6ft 4 and when the seat turns into a bed it slides the lower half of your body into a tiny plastic coffin-like box with no room to move your legs at all. It wasn't long enough for me - so it wasn't humanly possible to lie down! As a result I arrived at LHR tired and irritable lacking the sleep I had needed and paid for. The cabin crew were brilliant but they told me that a lot of other business class passengers had complained about this new seat. It's also difficult to get the seat back up again from a thr ""bed"". My seat 2A on C-FIVO was also missing a flexible reading light. It is a reasonably new aircraft so why on earth was that missing? Basically Air Canada has decided to shove more seats in every class onto this aircraft at the expense of comfort and space and every passenger is short-changed as a result. The B777-300ER that normally takes 359 passengers is being converted to 458 passengers - mine was one of them. The passenger loses. I have read that it is a plan to reduce cost per seat by 15%. It is a total disgrace - avoid this aircraft at all costs. Air Canada used to be a great airline but it is heading downhill. If this is the way Air Canada is going then it's time to change airlines folks."	0
On way to Orlando I got bumped to Premium rouge as a frequent flier. Unfortunately no Premium class provided. On the way back I flew in Economy class. Worst flight ever being cramped and bum hurt which never happens even during a 15 hour flight. People beside me also could not believe this bus class service. Flight Attendants nice but what cheesy outfits. Air Canada what happened to you! As a frequent flier they are giving me too many reasons not to be a loyal customer.	0
I had no idea what Air Canada 'Rouge' was until I experienced it on a trip from Toronto to Tampa on January 13 2015. Everything you read in the unflattering reviews is true. However to add insult to injury we had a full flight with no water in either of the washrooms! There was what appeared to be a well-worn sign in the washrooms apologizing for the lack of water and a supply of little individual towelettes to wipe your hands afterwards. On the trip back when the stewardess asked if I wanted a drink I asked first whether there was water in the washroom this time before deciding whether or not to drink anything. I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. I will fly another airline for my next trip to Florida in a few months time just to avoid the inconvenience of no leg room (and I'm barely 5 foot tall) discomfort of thinly padded seats inability to get in and out of any seats but the aisle nothing to ease boredom - not even a used newspaper from a previous flight. By far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on.	0
Over priced by a long shot. Due to the protection they get from the government they feel that it is their right to charge 1/3 more for flights. They claim that they will match competition pricing and actually publish on their site that they will but refuse to do so when approached. Online and phone reservation staff are confrontational and rude. Would not recommend them.	0
"I assumed that a large country like Canada would be a safe bet for my trip to New York. On the way out staff were a slow and unhelpful but our main complaint was the food - we boarded at 12 so assumed lunch would be provided instead a 'light snack' was served at 2.30 and there was no meat option because they had already run out. Before landing we were served another 'light snack' which was the smallest wrap I have seen. On the way home our flight was delayed at LGA for over an hour with barely any communication until we could board. Onboard my sister asked the attendant if we would make our connection - he looked at our ticket and said probably not without any sympathy or conciliatory expression. When he gave us immigration cards my sister told him we didn't need them as we were only transferring. He said ""you might if you have to stay overnight in Canada"" - a possibility that had not yet been suggested to us and which was delivered in an incredibly flippant way considering we had told him we had important work engagements we needed to keep the next morning. When we got to Montreal we rushed to the connections gate where Air Canada staff who were supposed to guide us told us the plane wasn't waiting for us despite there still being time to make it. The rest of the evening was spent walking from end to end of the airport as Air Canada staff constantly referred you to different colleagues for help. In the end we had to stay overnight in Montreal wake up at 3 to fly back to Toronto and then on to New York arriving in London 12 hours after planned. Even based on the first outward flight we know we will never fly with Air Canada again."	0
Flew to Dominican. I agree with all other reviews. Worst leg room ever. Expect lots of leg related health issues in the future because you truly cannot move your legs while inflight. I fly with AC frequently but will be looking at other options. I do not carry my IPAD with me nor do I wish to rent one for $10.	0
Firstly flight delayed 6 hours out of YYZ to LAS. Sure breakdowns happen. I was tracking the history of the aircraft online and it has been broken down and attempted to be put back into service 4 times in a week. I am 6 foot tall and the lack of leg room was not only insulting it is bordering on a health and safety issue. Air Canada Rouge would rather make the extra few bucks off cramming a few more seats on the plane than worry about whether passengers will be able to walk again after flying with them. I am so upset that I have cancelled my return flight with this airline.	0
Flew Toronto to Tampa on January 6. Air Canada Rouge is the only AC option on this route. Flight attendants tried their hardest and were pleasant. Only two of them however so service was very slow. Seats are worst I have ever flown - no leg room hard and thin seat cushions. I'm 192 cm and my knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Everything about the experience was cheap cheap cheap. Price was no different than regular AC service. I've been a regular and loyal AC customer for many many years. I would avoid AC Rouge and switch airlines if this is the only service AC would offer on the route I wanted. Trip satisfaction 4 out of 10 because we arrived safe and sound not because of the inflight experience!	0
5/9/2014 LHR to Vancouver AC855. 23/9/2014 Vancouver to LHR AC854. For Economy the leg room was OK compared to other airlines albeit still cramped. The staff were friendly and helpful. Entertainment system also OK. But the food! It is simply the worst quality I have ever encountered on a long haul flight and was so bad that I bought food from Subway in the airport to eat on the return flight. That turned out to be the right decision considering the quality on the return flight was as bad as on the outgoing flight. Simply not acceptable on a long haul flight and for that reason alone I will not fly Air Canada again.	0
Flew from Honolulu to Vancouver economy class. Ground staff were helpful and reasonably friendly. The plane was a 767-300 and the seat was very uncomfortable as the padding in the middle of the seat had vanished over the years. The four stewardesses in my area must have been 60ish and not up to speed. One stewardess asked a passenger to get out of his seat and close the overhead bin as she had a bad back. Knowing that Air Canada did not serve meals domestically I checked online about international flights and it said that meals were served. None provided. During the flight I was offered a decent beverage twice and a couple of times the stewardess came by with a tacky plastic jug and served lukewarm water. I travel to and from Asia quite often and have never experienced such poor service on any other airline. I will absolutely go out of my way to avoid flying Air Canada again.	0
Dubrovnik - Munich. A320 was full and while it was a short flight of just over an hour it seemed a lot longer as every second passenger seemed to be a screaming child. Maybe have flights where no passengers are under 5 years of age? Let's see which airline is brave enough to introduce such a restriction. After this performance I think next time I will pay a higher fare on the full fare airlines.	0
I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. If you are booking a cheap flight their service may be fine but when you book an all inclusive vacation with Air Canada and have to pay for baggage check-in food and entertainment it is not acceptable. The seats were uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight. $10 to rent an I-pad for entertainment. No in flight music or movie without the rental. Not everyone has an I-pad or takes it on their vacation. Pre- booking seats can only be done by calling Air Canada and waiting on line for 45 minutes or longer. I will never book another Vacation with Air Canada.	0
e flew from Vancouver to Kahului on Air Canada Rouge AC1827 and back on AC1828 a week ago. Alas this might be the last time we use this airline as it was the most uncomfortable seating and rudest crew. My back is still hurting after a week and we cancelled a trip to Hawaii that was coming up due to Air Canada Rouge. The crew was as usual arrogant and unprofessional. They decided to turn all the lights on half away through the red eye flight to distribute beverages while everyone was trying to sleep. As for the price there is no difference with mainstream Air Canada. You pay the same for a horrible experience.	0
"Booked Air Canada for a family vacation to Greece. Going there we dealt with rude staff. We brushed it off and believed it was just a bad day for them. Our return flight was no better. The flight back was from Athens Greece to Montreal and then Toronto. The sad thing was instead of returning home to Toronto on Saturday 4.30pm as our tickets stated we had the privilege of being bumped off our flight and sleeping at the Montreal airport with my 12 year old son and husband. No explanation was given except for ""sorry this flight is overbooked"". We had assigned seats and everything so how does this happen?? Apparently there was no hotel available that night either so it was a very rough night. I emailed customer service and still have had no reply."	0
The aircraft itself was clean seats however not very well padded. I'm not a very tall person but in order to sleep I had to lean forward on the tray table; I ended up being repeatedly suffocated by the person in front of me every time she reclined her seat. The entertainment system is okay and they dim the screens during the night to help you sleep. The food was good but it seems you only get the choice of Chicken or Pasta.	0
DUS-LAX-DUS. Check-in ok. Seat pitch much narrower than on other airlines little to no leg room. Food is average but had to pay for everything even non-alcoholic drinks. No IFE on outbound flight - limited IFE with shared monitor on return flight. Staff rather arrogant and unfriendly. Cabin and wash rooms dirty on departure on outbound flight. It seems Air Berlin offers two very different products under the same brand - I'm happy with the product for the European market but long-haul is not recommendable and not even cheap!	0
Flew from Montreal to Rome on Sept/18/2014 and returned Oct/18/2014. This was the worst experience of my life. Never again. Air Canada should be ashamed you are so cramped in your seat that can hardly breathe.	0
AC1831. Jan 10 2015. Absolutely awful. Paid for business class and got hostility class. Attendants terrible. Seating worse than economy on other flights. Will never fly AC again.	0
We flew Air Canada thinking we'll be getting a basic level of comfort common to all Air Canada planes but what a mistake. Didn't know about Rouge. There's no leg room minimal service no comfort no space in the overhead since people bring large carry-ons to avoid paying for checked-in luggage. The almost 5 hr flight to Phoenix from Toronto was painfully boring with the in-flight entertainment consisting of online streaming of old movies and shows. We had to bear all this again on the flight back!	0
We recently returned from New York La Guardia airport to London Heathrow. Our first flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight to London. Both my sister and I missed several appointments - work for myself and registration for her PhD and meetings for my sister. It was also my sister's 25th birthday which is an extra detail but made the subsequent experience much worse to take. Our return flight included a connection at Montreal - the plane from New York was delayed and from the offset the staff on the plane were incredibly rude disengaged and unhelpful when we asked for advice and reassurance. The whole process was terribly managed - we arrived at the boarding gate in time to see our plane pull away from the gate - some better communications and we definitely could have boarded that flight with a five minute delay for the other passengers at most. We were then sent around the airport with cursory explanations and a lack of basic guidance - for example no one explained there was a shuttle bus to the hotel or even pointed us in the right direction. There was a lack of staff in the airport due to it being a bit later in the evening and we felt completely unguided in the process. I was stunned that a customer-focused service could have such a poor grasp of good communications and moreover just didn't seem to care about it's customers as well. We arrived in London 12 hours after our scheduled arrival time. Overall the process was poor in itself - bad food stingy amounts. When my sister asked if we would be served another meal the attendant smirked and said 'You could loosely call it a meal'. I'd never fly with Air Canada again.	0
Flying from London Heathrow to Kingston Ontario is a tiring trip at the best of times flight delays on both legs due to “the late arrival of the aircraft from its previous destination” only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston.	0
The worst long haul airline and I travel a lot but I am doomed and have been for last 15 years as it is the only direct connection between London UK and Halifax Nova Scotia. The price is outrageous the service is generally poor (even in business I don't find it super friendly) and it is the only long haul airline where I have to bring my own food when I fly economy. Also completely inefficient and useless systems if you want to book an end to end flight using different members of Star Alliance for different legs of the flight (if not in the same class). Every time I have to deal with them I have to grit my teeth.	0
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Return from Fort Lauderdale to Ottawa. As many have said cramped. Rouge is overpriced. Reminded me of cheap flights UK to Spain 25 years ago. Yet for what one gets Rouge is not a cheap option. But at least the crew got us there and with a soft landing.	0
Less leg room than usual no inflight entertainment no hot meal for an almost 6 hour flight (If you want something you have to purchase it off their very limited food cart) and limited space in their overhead compartments. My husband was asked to hold our carry-on bag on his lap during take-off because there was no room in the overhead compartments and the bag did not fit under our seat. The staff on flight 1786 were not at all accommodating. Both my husband and I are not complainers but the service you get with Air Canada Rouge is totally unacceptable. They give you nothing for your money.	0
I flew with Rouge from YUL to SAN last year and was disappointed after using my eUpgrades to find out I was in the front of he airplane which is no different from Economy class in Air Canada. The seats were nothing like business class the service was so so we got an IPad for inflight entertainment and it felt like a 'charter type' airline. I wasn't aware that my flight was with Rouge so I was very disappointed when I entered the airplane and realized I was on the discount flight and had used my upgrades for this. I go to San Diego a couple of times a year and I will probably fly with United from now on since Air Canada doesn't give us an option to use Rouge when connecting to Canada.	0
Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.	0
Over the last two years we have taken 31 flights. Of those flights 11 were on Air Canada and on 8 of those 11 there were either delays of more than two hours or cancellations. My most recent was on Air Canada YVR to YEG - the flight was cancelled and it created a great deal of confusion for Air Canada. First they would let us know about putting on other flights in 15 minutes half an hour later they were still confused and lost. They said they would give a lunch voucher but couldn't get them to print and that took 45 minutes. Finally a lunch voucher that would buy an airport pre-made airport sandwich. Back after lunch and sched on flight in another hour (now 2.5 hours later). This is very typical or even quite good service for this airline. Food and beverages - if you like a mini bag of pretzels and some juice or water or coffee then great. I only travel Air Canada when absolutely necessary.	0
Vancouver to Honolulu. Booked Air Canada in Feb 2014 got changed to Rouge. Worst flying experience ever. Flight to Honolulu was 1 hour late returning flight was over 3 hours late. Seats are uncomfortable with no legroom even in Premium class. We were charged the same prices as Air Canada nothing on Rouge is close to a regular Air Canada flight. We have flown many low cost carriers in Europe for 1/10 the cost with better service. Will never fly Rouge again it is awful. Inflight entertainment is a real laugh. My wife and I are regular Air Canada customers. I would rate trip satisfaction value for money and seat comfort 0 as other passengers have done.	0
"Traveled to Phoenix Dec 18th for two weeks holiday and booked Air Canada as usual. One week prior to departure rec'd an Air Rouge email - oh well had no idea what it was. Now I can inform you - it was awful - a throw back to Air Transat planes 20 to 25 years ago. The seats were so close you could not sit with your legs straight if you are tall and you could not cross your legs let alone your ankles. Once the person ahead put her seat back I could not move or would have hit my head on the back of her seat. There ought to be a law re safety -- none of us would have been able to move to get out in an emergency and what about health insuch cramped quarters. The correct spelling is not ""Air Rouge"" - it is ""Air Ruse""! I will never take an Air Rouge flight again."	0
On January 8 2015 I had the displeasure of being a passenger on Air Canada Rouge flight 1828 from Maui to Vancouver and prior to that Air Canada Rouge flight 1827 from Vancouver to Maui. I begin by comparing the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 to the Rouge Boeing 767. You will note from the seating chart that the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 has 39 rows with eight passengers per row. The Rouge aircraft has 49 rows. The additional ten rows undoubtedly speaks volumes to the uncomfortable seating mentioned by many. Like many of the previous commentators I have been a member of the Air Canada Altitude 50K group for years. In good faith I booked with Air Canada to discover my flight to be with Rouge. The Rouge seats are extremely uncomfortable and offer an average sized passenger little if any leg room. Your knees are crushed when the passenger in front moves their seat back. Comparatively the seats are similar to sitting on a wooden church pew for the duration of the flight. I will never again fly Rouge. From Edmonton there are a number of other options available.	0
I am a Star Alliance Gold Card holder and fly business class frequently. I just returned from a trip to Thailand and flew the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg (return) business class in their newly configured 777-300 series aircraft. The new business class seating arrangement on this aircraft is an unmitigated disaster. Where do I begin! It is primarily a 2-2-2 layout with 3 rows being 1-2-1. This single seat is only available to AC super elite members. So AC has decided that any other full fare business class travelers on this aircraft are not entitled to a single seat. Ridiculous. The tight seats are far too firm and narrow footwells make it impossible to properly stretch out and have a relaxing sleep. There is no storage area and materials used are cheap and do not even belong in a Premium Economy section. Window passengers do not have a clear access to the aisle. You have to climb over the other passenger. This is unacceptable in a business class in today's airline industry! I browsed through the Duty Free Magazine located in the seat pocket in front of each seat and asked the Flight Attendant if I could order something. She advised me that the configuration of this aircraft did not permit any duty free sales on board. No duty free on board when there is a duty free magazine located in every seat pocket! I will never fly on this aircraft again and my frequent flights to Asia will be on other Star Alliance carriers which are improving their business class product not reducing it to cattle car status such as AC.	0
Flew LHR to Vancouver Premium Economy on newish plane with different layout premium economy is no longer separated by a bulkhead and curtain so we had to put up with kids running up and down the aisles and noise. On top of this they messed up on our return flight from Calgary. No premium economy available so we chose the front two seats in economy they changed the plane last May didn't tell us so we lost the seats after a few calls to the call centre in India they refunded the charge for the so called premium seats but it's not a money issue we wanted the seats. Arrive at the airport and now we have to pay $70 for our third case that was FOC on the way out. We explained we would have booked it if we could but no joy they charged us. The only way to complain is to write to them apparently which we will for sure. Based on these issues I wouldn't recommend this airline.	0
Dec 15 2014 AC1828 and AC1876 Jan 9 2015. Terrible. Avoid at all costs. I travel quite frequently and am of reasonable height/weight. The seats are tiny and uncomfortable. Knees pressed against the seat ahead. Barely any lean back because you'd slam into the person behind you. Very small storage above. Inflight 'entertainment' didn't work. 5.5hrs to Maui. Paid top dollar. Lots of other people commented the same. Nice staff not the jaded older ones that can be found on regular AC flights.	0
YVR-LAX on 1/12. Can't complain about the service as the attendants were workmanlike. Seating as noted by most reviewers is awful. The in-flight Wi-Fi service did not work initially and when I finally corralled a flight attendant she laughed and told me that the crew had forgotten to turn it on. By the time they did turn it on we were third of the way through our 2.5 hr. flight. Would fly this airline again on short routes no more than 2 to 2 1/2 hours and only with an aisle or exit row seat. Otherwise caveat emptor.	0
I flew from Toronto to Tokyo on my way to Manila on 22 Oct and had the worst service experience I had in a long haul flight (12 hrs). I was seated at the window seat on several occasions I had a request for food water in the middle of the flight I pressed the attendant button waited more than 20 mins then an attendant went by and just went past no stopping on our side of the aisle and asking if anybody needed anything this happened in the middle of the flight when everyone was asleep so I didn't want to call out loudly but was waving my hands. This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant. On the way back flying from Tokyo to Toronto I opted for an aisle seat thinking it was easier to get their attention it was but they were not the friendliest or most cordial I was asking for snacks in the middle of the long flight I was asked to go to the back myself to get pretzels and cookies. No more long haul Air Canada flights for me if I can avoid it.	0
A trip from home from Greece to Calgary resulted in arrival 41 hours after the scheduled time. Air Canada did not contact me once during this time only provided vague updates through the hotel staff. On the ensuing flight from Greece customers were still charged $10 rental fees to use the in-flight iPads despite being delayed more than a day and a half. Disgusting customer service and clearly poor plane maintenance practices. A good way to ruin a vacation is to fly with Air Canada.	0
Last August after returning to Toronto from San Diego on Air Canada Rouge I couldn't walk properly for a week. The seat space was so small I felt that I was being punished for the full five five hours of my trip. Since I'm just under six feet I wondered how the tall people were handling the unconscionable seating. I didn't write a letter then but vowed not to take Rouge again. However Rouge became the only option on a recent return trip to Tampa. I had the same negative experience.	0
Booked business class with Aeroplan direct flight Toronto to Cancun only to end up on AC Rouge not by choice. Flight 1810 January 8/15. Premium Rouge is not close to AC business class level at all and I don't feel it should be charging the same amount of points for Premium Rouge. Usually you are served water or juice on arrival to aircraft but there was a delay with that. The overhead bins above the middle seat section were too small to accommodate most regular size carry-ons. The inflight entertainment was non-existant and iPads were offered free to Premium rouge customers $15 for economy customers. We could have used our own iPads to watch the movies offered if we had known and downloaded an app for this. We were told this quite rudely by the air attendant who seemed quite annoyed we didn't already know that is how it's done on AC rouge. The iPads weren't handed out for an hour and collected about 45 min prior to landing so we did not get to finish our movies. You were also unable to hear any announcements when you had earphones in listening to the iPads which I'm sure is not allowed by the safety guidelines. The first drink service was after the iPads. The meal was very tasty and good but too bad no switch up with menu as we had flown previous day with same menu. Seats smaller and very old and no support. I am not sure if they were short staffed that day or what but all the attendants seemed very unhappy and rude. I would never fly this airline by choice and I think Air Canada should have a serious look at keeping this airline. We were unhappy in business class so I cannot imagine how those in economy felt.	0
"LAS to YYC was the worst I have experienced. Seats are jammed in. They are narrow and there is no room between the seat in front of you. I am only 5' 7"" but could not sit straight with my knees together. They were jammed into the seat in front of me. I could not put my laptop on the tray unless it sat at an angle. Entertainment system was a joke. First of all they announced after we were asked to put our phones on flight mode to download the Air Canada Ap. This information should have been announced in the boarding lounge. Even if you had the ap it could not be used until 45 minutes after we left the gate and had to be turned off when we started our descent (1/2 hour before landing). Staff announced we were headed for Vancouver; not Calgary. They seemed like this was their first flight and were unsure of everything. They were like excited kids but not helpful. This is the first and last time I will flying Air Canada Rouge."	0
We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues. The overhead lockers on the YYC to YVR were inadequate leaving everyone a scamble to find space anywhere they could. I would give any other airline a try next time - Air Canada performance leaves much to be desired.	0
"On September 8 I boarded my connection flight scheduled to depart at 6.30pm from Calgary to London Heathrow but after boarding the pilot announces that there was a problem with the de-icing device. They spent hours trying to fix the problem but in the end the flight was canceled. By the time we walked out of the plane it was almost midnight. I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our ""checked-in"" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my ""checked-in"" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening. Needless to say it was a sleepless night. As a single Canadian adult traveling by myself with all the right gadgets and adequate travel insurance I was lucky enough to sort everything out myself albeit with endless frustrations. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been for foreigner families or elderly people with hearing problems. Because of this experience I will probably take a vacation from Air Canada for a long long time."	0
If you've spent any time reading on-line reviews of Rouge service and you're still considering booking a Rouge flight don't do it! I was Rouged once when the service was first introduced and vowed to never fly with them again. Unfortunately I made the mistake of consciously booking with Rouge while thinking that it couldn't still be as bad as my first experience - I was wrong! My YUL-LAS return flights over the past two weeks were a complete disaster in every possible way. I even earned a compensation reward (that will never be used!) for one of the flights. I fly a lot including regular transpacific flights (not with Air Canada!) and super discount flights on Chinese airlines. Nothing compares to the poor quality of service on Rouge. Rouge seats are terribly uncomfortable the flight attendants are clueless the planes are old and not well maintained (does anyone enjoy blocked overflowing toilets).	0
We flew Air Canada for years because we knew we could depend on a pleasant experience and a comfortable ride - a far cry from your typical charter. On a recent trip to the Caribbean on AC rouge we were treated to incredibly uncomfortable and cramped seats a dingy and dirty interior a flaky electrical system (lights on lights off like magic if the lights worked at all) and an unreliable entertainment system (maybe you can watch a movie maybe we'll be having bandwidth allocation problems and you won't be able to). We brought our own devices for the entertainment system but there is no charging capability. How handy. And the light switches are on the arm rest so my neighbour's elbow was also quite efficient at turning it on and off unexpectedly. The flight was late both directions didn't seem to be weather related. Nobody made their connection on the way back forcing them to stay overnight. So no incentive to choose AC again that's for sure. We were always willing to pay a bit more in the past. Now we might as well go with any low-quality discount airline. Apparently they are all the same.	0
"I don't think you could get any worst! I also was ""rouged"" as I took a flight from YUL-MCO. Being 6'4 I would rather get a root canal then have to sit on a rouge plane again. I am in disgust that Air Canada would create such a terrible product when their mainland carrier is great. I am an altitude member and fly often with AC and somehow have managed to avoid this airline for almost two years and will never take another rouge flight as long as I can help it. The entertainment selection was terrible not that I had enough room to watch it on my ipad as my legs where twisted in a pretzel trying to find a comfortable place for my legs. Never again!"	0
"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding."	0
I have been flying to Hawaii for over 30 years always Business class on Air Canada but Air Canada Rouge which is part of Air Canada has got to be the worst experience I have had. The equipment is old 767 aircraft. I confirm this with the flight attendant because the bathrooms were in really bad shape. The seats were new and hard and no longer flat beds. You can get spoiled when you pay for Air Canada business-class prices for economy experiences. The food was good but they ran out of my choice. Do not fly Air Canada rouge unless you need to use this airline. No TV on back of seats and bring your iPad.	0
Travelled from Heathrow to Vancouver we sat for 90 mins on the runway with little info but just problems with one of the engines. The TV did not work and we had to wait for the stewardess to be ready to re boot it! The seats are 3x4x3 and very little leg room although the leather seats were quite comfortable. The worst thing was the rude service we got from the air hostesses they looked like it was too much trouble to do anything for you! The food on return flight was appalling before we landed we were handed a yoghurt and a dry slab of some kind of cake. For the price of the flights I felt the great films did not make up for the bad service poor food and cramped conditions!	0
Booked a flight in February to Greece since booking our return flight has been changed 4 times. We first had one stop in Montreal then straight to Edmonton landing at 10.30 pm. After the 4th change Air Canada had added another layover in Toronto after Montreal now returning at 1.30 am. I wouldn't have booked this flight if I knew this is the way they operate. There are too many other airlines that never change there flights no matter how full or empty the flights are. Book through another provider.	0
Our family flew from Vancouver to Sydney in Business Class on the final leg of an around the world trip. All other Star Alliance airlines were great. Air Canada was shocking! There were no shower facilities in the Air Canada lounge in Vancouver. The aircraft was very dirty. Crumbs of food smeared sticky stuff old rubbish around our seats. We had ordered special meals due to medical conditions for 3 family members. The food was inedible - overcooked. Our business class meal consisted of chicken that was too hard to cut potatoes that disintegrated as soon as we tried to pick it up with a fork. Dessert was a small fruit salad. We were offered our breakfast instead of our dinner in case that was better and the crew were understanding but there were no other food options available for a 19 hour flight. We were hungry for 19 hours (travelling with 2 children). This would have been unacceptable in economy. Upon receiving our complaint Air Canada offered 10% discount off our next flight. Useless as we will never fly with them again.	0
"Vancouver to Maui on Air Canada Rouge December 13 2014 - this was the worst flight. Seats were the most uncomfortable. For the cost of this flight I was expecting more for the money. I will not be flying with Air Canada any more for the simple fact that when the flights were booked back in August there was no mention of Rouge and there certainly was no discount for that portion of our flight. Time to go back to old system.. I do not recommend flying rouge if your flight is over 1 hour long or if you are over 5' 5"" good luck trying to fit your knees in front of you in your seat. Goodbye Air Canada Rouge!"	0
Jan 16 2015 OGG-YVR. What kind of a system of 3 zones to load an aircraft? Simply ineffective annoying and takes extra time to load the aircraft. What were Air Canada thinking? Service was rated as zero just like a charter flight. No more Air Canada!	0
Toronto to Phoenix. What happened here? Last year it was standard comfortable economy and this year we were jammed in like cattle. Never again will we travel Rouge! The couple next to me had an 18 month old baby on their lap. Awful for everyone.	0
"Toronto to San Diego / return and lucky to have aisle seat. Loading time is long as middle and window seat passengers have to squeeze in and out. I'm 5'10"" and my knees touch seat in front."	0
Regular Air Canada customer and had probably the worst airline experience that I can remember. Flight 1807 from San Jose to Toronto on Jan.4th. Initially scheduled to arrive on Sunday afternoon then changed some time ago to Monday morning at 1.40am. Plane was then delayed with no explanation for two hours and sat on the runway for another 25 minutes. The new seat spacing is absurd. If you are over 5ft 10 do not use this airline. Arrived Toronto approx. 4.30am on Jan 5th with partner and two younger kids to find that the bags did not arrive with the plane. To date no info on when they will arrive.	0
The first and last time I fly Rouge. What a disappointment! My previous flights to Honolulu were on Air Canada not Rouge. When I boarded the Rouge jet in December 2014 I noticed there was no inflight entertainment. A 6 hour flight with no inflight entertainment? Air Canada should let travellers know that the 767's they fly to Honolulu have no inflight entertainment. Had I know this I would not have flown Rouge to Honolulu.	0
London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.	0
"Recently flew from Toronto to Phoenix and were quite surprised to find ourselves on Rouge-we certainly weren't aware we were booking it. Never again. Seats were horribly uncomfortable-on the flight down my husband and I both ended up with back pain because the seat forced me to sit with my shoulders slumped forward. I've also never been on a plane with so little leg room-maybe three inches from my knees to the seat in front and I'm only 5'2"". Flight back was slightly better (different seats) but still uncomfortable. We noticed several rows of ""prestige"" seats as we got on the plane but they were the same as all the other seats except with a bit more leg room. There were only 3 flight attendants for the entire plane one and a half of whom were dedicated to business class so service was slow. As other people have said there's no inflight entertainment unless you happen to have an iPad. I generally read so that's not an issue for me but I'd have been in trouble if my e-reader ran out of charge as there were also no plugs or usb ports available. And though it's a small thing the uniforms are hideous especially the hats which looked to be ""one size fits nobody."""	0
"I flew to Phoenix from Toronto on Dec 28th Business Class and returned Jan 5 2015. Both were equally disturbing in their own way. The bottom line is that if Air Canada is going to charge full fare on a flight then it should not be ""charter"" quality. If I pay to fly business then I should get what I pay for. As for economy the leg room is atrocious for a 5 hour flight. If the person in front of you leans back then their seat is a few inches from your nose. Also we were not warned ahead of time that there would be no entertainment- they tell you to download the app to watch movies on an Ipad or Iphone but they provide no charging mechanism for your battery so you are forced to rent an Ipad for $10. If we are paying the same rates as a regular Air Canada flight shouldn't the entertainment be free just like on those flights? Air Canada used to be my go-to airline. No more- certainly not if I have to take a long haul flight on Rouge. They are shooting themselves in the foot. They used to claim ""Best Airline in North America five years in a row"". This will never happen again if they continue on this path. Extremely disappointing."	0
HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.	0
Flight from Heathrow to Ottawa AC889 - myself and my husband and daughter. We had paid top prices to travel to visit family in Canada. On boarding the plane we were not greeted merely nodded at by a 'gentleman' who barely glanced at our boarding passes and said 'down there'! Not a great start and this attitude and lack of care or service continued throughout the flight. Not one of the cabin crew smiled during the whole flight - for which I was awake the whole time! Yes we were travelling economy class however we had paid premium prices for these flights! Very disappointing to be treated so poorly. As for the 'food' - words fail me!	0
YUL-LAS 767-300. I knew it was going to be bad but still I was curious to fly rouge and experience it. The plane was very old worn and dirty non existent leg-room poor selection of movies from their wifi IFE cabin crew okay but very young and inexperienced never felt safe with them food options a joke and unhealthy. This product would be acceptable if low cost but the prices are the same as AC mainline and the offering is tremendously below standards. I had better flights with real low cost carriers in Europe or Asia for 1/10 of the price paid. Good things landed on time and my baggage arrived too. I won't get rouged ever again.	0
"If I can help it there is no way I will utilize Air Canada Rouge again. The leg room is terrible - my knees were jammed into the seat in front of me the whole time from Toronto to Phoenix and for the return flight back. If the person in front of you reclines their seat it is absolute torture. Out of 4 flights in total from Ottawa to Phoenix we had 7 planes due to mechanical failures. Very archaic options for in flight entertainment. If I could give 0 stars for ""Value for Money"" and ""Seat Comfort"" I would."	0
Outbound flight FRA/PRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinks/snacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKP/LJU/FRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinks/snacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however it's possible to go to a gate within 30min.	1
Two short hops ZRH-LJU and LJU-VIE. Very fast on CRJ 90. Seats comfortable and crew was fine. Ground services good and lounge was quite nice.	1
Flew Zurich-Ljubljana on JP365 newish CRJ900. Flight almost full departure on time. Service on board by 2 pleasant and friendly female flight attendants. I bought coffee mineral water and a very nice and fresh filled croissant for EUR 6. Good value!	1
Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain. The food offering could be slightly improved for usually I've had good meals on Adria.	1
Sarajevo-Frankfurt via Ljubljana. I loved flying with them. Very small airline but a functional one. Crew friendly on board nothing special regarding entertainment or service. But flight duration's were short too so nothing to complain about. What I loved the most was a fast transit process in Ljubljana since its small airport and immigration was very fast. Would choose them again on my future trips.	1
I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.	1
LJU to FRA and back both flights were on time. Flights were made by CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Very clean cabin and comfortable seats. Staff were always nice and friendly. New SkyShop service was excellent with nice prices and it's not too expensive.	1
On my Ljubljana - Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ-900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.	1
Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but it's fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.	1
I was very satisfied with the CRJ 900 on my flight from Zagreb to Istanbul. The aircraft's are very clean fresh new and the staff was very helpful. Besides I felt very safe and comfortable in the aircraft.	1
I was on JP650 the evening departure to Istanbul on 28th August. It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.	1
If I have to fly a regional jet then I prefer the new generation CRJ 900 which Adria used on today's flight from Amsterdam to Ljubljana. It has much bigger windows which makes the cabin look more spacious. Despite Adria cutting back on a lot of their routes for what it is the service food and cabin is OK.	1
Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.	1
Return flight Paris-Skopje via Ljubljana. All flights were on time and nice very clean planes / good flight crew. Seats were comfortable enough for a 1-2 hours flight. Boarding was easy for all flights. Ljubljana airport is very small and nice. The only downside is the absence of any snack. FA served only water and coffee/tea. This is almost like low cost airline. It is recommended airline for short flights.	1
BEG-LJU-BEG with CRJ200 great regional airline with excellent airport. Too bad the airport is not too busy. Both flights were on time and they had Duty Free service with certain items on special prices. Their tickets are not good may be that is a reason that they are on economic difficulties.	1
LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full. Passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to LJU and carry the bags to the terminal building.	1
Ljubljana to Brussels with CRJ900. Boarding on time. The aircraft looked quite new and very clean. Meal served was above my expectations. Cabin crew were very nice. The only thing that was bad was the seating arrangement. I sat in 13th or 14th row and that row didn't have any windows! Otherwise flight was ok.	1
LJU-FRA and FRA-LJU. First flight on time return flight slightly delayed due to heavy snow in FRA. Flight attendants attentive and helpful. Delicious snacks on both flights. While waiting for take off on first leg passengers were served Slovenian sparkling wine juices and water. Comfortable seats and generous leg- room with CRJ 900 to FRA and CRJ 200 to LJU. Both airplanes very clean and seemingly well maintained all in all quite an enjoyable experience.	1
Smart and efficient service. Small planes but as a tall man (6ft 4) I did not feel cramped either on the CRJ-200 (AMS-LJU) or the CRJ-900 (LJU-AMS). The cabin crew were friendly and the food for such a short flight was good. Also the price was right.	1
FRA-VIE in Business Class. A great little airline transferred to them after our transatlantic flight. The advantage for the CRJ sitting on a remote stand was that we got a really interesting ride around Frankfurt airport with operating aircraft taxiing landing taking off all around us. Onboard the crew were pleasant and managed to serve a hot lunch to us during the 60 mins flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth.	1
London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens. Otherwise very good flights. Cabin crew friendly and welcoming ensuring that you were okay - without being too pushy and forward. Short flights and light meals/snacks served.	1
ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.	1
"This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price."	1
ZRH-LJU-ZRH with CRJ-900. New plane with pleasant cabin interior and comfortable leather seats. Flights on time food ok. Adria Airways has new uniforms (60 style) and the flight attendants are attentive. Web-Check-in works excellent.	1
It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.	1
Flight to Larnaca was a joy. Generous legroom, nice meals and a fantastic range of drinks to choose from. Crew was attentive and it is nice that Aegean leave the cockpit door open during boarding..	1
Flight on time, row 1 - Friendly staff and very attentive, tasting 3 course meal and wines. Only complaint, please change the welcome and inflight “sparkling Greek wine” to real champagne. Star Alliance priority bags arrived promptly at baggage carousel Heathrow.	1
Very good flight with Aegean. The boarding was quickly and the crew very . During the flight, we had no entertainment (no films, no flight info). The food was an olive bread with a free no-alcoholic beverage (the first was free). Very smooth landing at Heraklion.	1
Brand new A320, interior spotless. Crew immaculately groomed and attentive. Flight was on time. I was impressed with my first experience of Aegean.	1
2 flights - HER to ATH (short 50 minutes) and ATH to MXP. Both went well and flights were on time. Unexpected snacks and drinks on flight. Breakfast on MXP flight. Fast check-in, friendly cabin staff and quick baggage claim.	1
Managed to get my rather large luggage quickly. First flight was on time, the A321 was clean and the Flight hosts were pleasant and friendly. Hot food was served and had an overall pleasant flight. Seats were comfortable enough, they seemed to be the same as the one Lufthansa originally put on their planes and I guess everyone went with them. Arriving in Athens there was a delay of half an hour due to congested skies as its the summer peak time. Boarded on time again a friendly staff with a good plane. They are a great choice.	1
I recently flew to Mykonos through Athens and must say it was a very pleasant experience. The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase. But I guess that's more a matter of the airport than the airline.	1
A good flight, on time. Flight attendants were pleasant and friendy. Was traveing with my partner, we got bored halfway through the flight as there is no inflight entertainment system. Hot food was served, overall a positive experience.	1
We flew Heathrow-Athens return and Athens-Santorini. The entire experience was very good. We were a bit delayed on our return flight to Heathrow and were continually updated on progress. The seats were comfortable and not tight. A hot meal was served in flight - no fee and a beverage was even included. This was on a three hour flight - a really nice touch. Unfortunately, my gluten free meal which had been ordered was not on board but the flight attendant provided a very nice salad and a sincere apology. All in all, we had a very enjoyable flight each time.	1
Very good flight, nice to be offered a hot meal on the ARN-ATH leg with complimentary drinks (two rounds), nice and rather spacious seats and legroom on the ARN-ATH leg, On the ATH-JTK / JTK-ATH Leg they used a A321 with cramped max tight config so almost no legroom, but it is a very short flight so it was ok, only a small snack, no drinks but I dont think they would have time to serve on this short flight. ATH-ARN was again great legroom and also served a hot breakfast. For what we pay it is great value, far better than many other competing airlines, the planes are also new and clean. Only drawback is that there is no entertainment provided on the 3 hr flight, why not show a movie?	1
Return LHR-ATH.  Clean, plane seemed quite new.  Staff are friendly and multi-lingual (at least 3 languages on top of Greek).  Food is well above average and so is legroom.  But bring a book or some entertainment - no in-flight entertainment on this 3.5 hour flight.  But overall, I was very impressed. Would happily fly with them again and recommend to friends.	1
Flew from Athens to Santorini and back. Flight was an hour late leaving Athens due to congestion at Santorini return was 30 minutes late. Cabin was very clean crew friendly and impressed that a snack was offered onboard when returning to Athens. Due to turbulence when flying to Santorini the crew could not offer the inflight service so this was handed out when leaving the aircraft. Traveled with 6 month old baby and our bags got priority tags so this sped up the airport experience. Overall an excellent airline and would like to experience them on a longer journey.	1
Athens to Corfu on Olympic Air Bombardier Dash400-8 series aircraft (A3 402). Corfu to Athens on Aegean Airbus A320 aircraft (A3 405). Excellent service very clean cabin flights on time and smiling staff.	1
LHR-ATH return. Plenty of legroom - better than some intercontinental I have been on. Food was OK; a little on the plain side. Service was very good and superbly efficient despite both flights being at capacity but the crew could smile a little more. At least as good as BA and a step up from KLM AF or Lufthansa for regional flights - very pleasantly surprised.	1
Traveled on 27 May from Zurich to Larnaca on business class. Check-in (mobile) fast and uncomplicated. Airline flew on time crew was very friendly and caring food and beverages were excellent. Information provided from crew was clear and continuous. Overall a very pleasant experience.	1
Flew CPH-ATH on May 21 economy class. Nice airline that provides you a free meal and full bar service. The dinner consisted of tasty pasta with minced meat and a small biscuit for dessert and considering that you normally get zero for free these days in Europe it was very pleasant! Clean aircraft good information and attentive service will definitively fly Aegean again!	1
Athens-Prague on 11 May. Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft. All in all Aegean is a hidden gem of an airline - I had a very good experience with Aegean and I would be glad to fly them again when I can.	1
"Flew Istanbul to Athens for a connection to Santorini. Flights were all on time and the crew were great. They were short flights so no inflight entertainment and only a drink which was all that was needed. On our landing in Santorini we did a ""go around"". About 50feet from a touchdown the pilot powered up and off we went. The pilot came on the PA and advised us of a change in wind direction and all was good. First time for me and very exciting. Great that the pilot kept us up to date and well informed. Quick boarding and the bags were on the conveyer within minutes of us waiting for them."	1
ATH-BRU (March 2015). The flight was as it should be very friendly and helpful crew the flight was on time despite the fact was almost full. The breakfast was quite good in quantity with the only handicap the taste of the Greek 'tyropita' wasn't so equally tasty as a traditional cheese pie. Thoroughly clean and new aircraft. I will fly with them definitely next time.	1
TXL-ATH-CHQ (Chania Crete) and return in March 2014. New slim line seats with hard seatback and short cushion that doesn't properly support thighs so you are forced to sit in a very unnatural and cramped position. The further back on the plane the smaller legroom gets i.e. new seats + seat in the back = nightmare while older seats in front of the cabin are very comfortable. Apart from that pleasant flights with good service hot pasta meal on TXL-ATH small though but at least one of the few remaining airlines to serve warm meals on intra- european flights. Even on the short ATH-CHQ hop they serve drinks and a cake. As they charge extra fees for every checked bag people carrying incredible amounts of luggage into the cabin making boarding a bit chaotic. Cabin baggage restrictions should be enforced.	1
Heathrow to Thessaloniki via Athens. Stress free check in at the new Terminal Two at Heathrow. Comfortable flight with adequate inflight hospitality with very friendly crew on all flights. Baggage checked through to our final destination and seamless transfer of flights in Athens. Clean and new Airbus A321/320 on all flights. Excellent experience would definitely fly them again.	1
TLV-SKG with stop in LAR (Laranca) SKG-TLV with stop in ATH 17/3  TLV-LAR leg Airbus 320-200 with excellent leg room no refreshments no entertainment (short flight) on time very efficient crew. 17/3 LAR-SKG on time Airbus 320-200 small leg room hard seats not comfortable very poor meal. 19/3 SGK-ATH on time Airbus 320-200 small leg room hard seats  not comfortable no entertainment (short flight). 19/3 ATH-TLV. Small delay Airbus 320 with excellent leg room very poor meal efficient crew. Clean aircraft's on all flights.	1
I flew 2 times this month from Zurich to Athens and back and I must say that I'm really glad this airline has included Switzerland to its destinations. I always left and arrived on time the crew was very friendly and professional and I found the inflight magazine interesting to read. Aegean definitely is one of my favourite airlines.	1
Arrived somewhat early for the flight and had to wait an hour for check-in to open as the queue continued to grow. However, check-in staff were friendly and quickly got through the line. A full flight so boarding was a tad chaotic moreso due to passengers not obeying the gate announcements. The flight closed up 25 mins after scheduled takeoff time (8.35pm) and consequently the pilot informed us we missed our slot and could not be airborne until 9.50pm Luckily, the situation improved and we took off at 9.30pm arriving in Dublin only 15 mins behind schedule. The senior cabin manager was delightful, accommodating and always smiling. Nice flight, efficient inflight service, cockpit updates and baggage delivered very quickly upon arrival. All in all a very good experience despite the initial delays.	1
Was delayed in Dublin, flight cancelled to Jersey in the end, but put in marvellous hotel, provided 3 course meal and prompt transport back to airport in the morning. Greatful thanks to Aer Lingus and taxi service they provided.	1
I flew to Heraklion and Aantorini from Athens in February. Seats are fine with decent leg room unfortunately there's no proper inflight entertainment on the flight. The service carried out by the cabin crew are professional and efficient. My return flight from Heraklion was delayed due to some technical difficulties. But we still managed to arrive in Athens on time. My flight to Santorini was short so they couldn't really carry out the full service but they still manage to give us cookies and fresheners. I would definitely take Aegean again on my next journey to Greece.	1
Traveled on February 20th from Athens to Larnaca on Flight A3-908. I must say that the professionalism of the cabin crew was excellent. Although the flight was very short the cabin crew were smiling warm hearted to everyone and even at a time when they had to deal with a passenger that was demanding for more and more alcohol the cabin crew dealt with it with professionalism defusing the situation without embarrassing the passenger. I would definitely choose Aegean again for my trips.	1
LHR-ATH-CHQ Return 13th February 2015 - 21st February 2015. I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the £20! Flight to Chania was a bit poorly organised but landed on time. Return flights were also very good and a mercifully shorter stop over in Athens!	1
I had a connection in Dublin for 2 hours, which stresses me out the most. During the JFK-DUB leg, the crew was the most hospitable crew I have met. My seat was broken, making me recline without pressing the button, and the IFE had a pretty poor choice of movies, but other than that, Aer Lingus left me with an impression. Dublin Airport is clean, and when I was there for the connection, we were the only outbound flight, so the terminal was empty. Would fly with Aer Lingus again, especially with their incredible prices.	1
"I was positively surprised when I recently in July 2015 flew with a friend from London Heathrow to Belfast City Airport and back again. I booked tickets several weeks in advance and got a good value flight. The website was clear with what one needed to pay extra. With the flight only an hour, I didn't want to pay extra for premium economy seats that would've guaranteed a more comfortable flight for a tall person like me (2m). Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn't fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the ""legacy"" airlines, as opposed to the ""low-cost"" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK. I've not flown Aer Lingus long-haul, so I can't comment, but based on this experience I would be ready to try Aer Lingus transatlantically if they offered a good price and connection."	1
FRA-SKG Business class. Seat was standard European Business class seat (same as Economy class and middle seat was blocked). 3 course menu with Greek wines. They have standard coffee cappuccino espresso also. I was eating 70min of the 150 min flight! They have a only business class passengers bus between parking spots and the terminal.	1
Our flight from Rhodes to Athens on route to Heathrow was cancelled with sufficient notice given. To fix this they got us tickets on Olympic leaving the same day just a couple of hours earlier. Flight from Athens to Heathrow was very pleasant and we arrived on time. Staff were all friendly and willing to assist even the office staff in regards to our cancelled flights were very helpful.	1
Athens to Larnaca economy. Early morning flight. Departing punctually serves simple breakfast. Crew friendly and efficient.	1
MUC-SKG on 17th of Dec. One-way. New A320 with new style of seats quite uncomfortable though. Friendly and nice crew. A hot meal was served in this short flight and drinks. However passengers didn't obey at all to the new cabin baggage rules causing space problems and minor delays and the crew did nothing about it. Rules should be more strictly enforced.	1
Flew London to Athens and then on to Ioannina and then from Ioannina to Athens and back to London. Great flight new and comfortable planes professional crew good meals and snacks. Great airline with great product. When and if I ever go to Greece again I will fly with Aegean.	1
Very good experience. Check-in and boarding were quick and efficient. The airplane is very clean and the cabin crew were friendly and helpful. There is a good variety of food sold on the airplane.	1
Flew from Belfast to Gatwick, the plane was oldish and not very comfortable, I felt really squashed where I was sitting. Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one.	1
I had a flight on October 14 going from ATH to HER and back upgrading my economy ticket to business by spending some miles on the aegean miles program. I had an excellent light meal the personnel of the aircraft was gentle and smiley. The seat was the same like the economy class but it was comfortable enough.	1
I flew on October 5th then on to Mykonos. I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.	1
SFO-DUB, LHR-DUB-SFO. Ground staff excellent. On time departure. Flight staff were just going through the motions and seemed as though they couldn't care less about the passengers. Seating was tight, but bearable. Inflight entertainment was pretty good. Meals were not so good and beverage service was below standard. Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though. I recommend Aer Lingus as an alternative airlines if you are looking for a budget alternative to flying.	1
JFK-SNN-LHR, FCO-DUB-JFK. The first leg of this trip, JFK-SNN, was operated by Air Contractors (I actually think this was the best flight out of the 4). The Boeing 757 cabin was clean. There were pillows and blankets on each seat. The IFE was sufficient for a ~5 hour flight. There was a meal 1-1.5 hours after takeoff (Chicken or Beef). It was okay and what one would expect of an airline meal. SNN-LHR and FCO-DUB were on A320s. The planes were clean but the seats were a little bit tight. There were no IFE on both flights and they charged for food and beverage. DUB-JFK on an A330 dual aisle plane. No pillow and blanket at my seat but they had blankets available for the passengers. The IFE was again sufficient for 7 hour flight. There was a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing. The boarding process on all 4 flights were effective and all 4 flights left on time. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The check in staff at FCO T1 was not but can't really fault them on that.	1
This was my third flight with Aegean in the last three years. I had pleasant experiences with my other two but wanted to reconfirm consistency before I rated this airline. Travelled LHR to ATH this time. Plane was clean and comfortable (for a 3 hour or so flight). My compliments to the staff. As in past flights they very pleasant warm and professional. Food served was as good as can be expected.	1
SKG - ATH and JMK - SKG in early August. Outbound flight was 15 minutes late. Check-in was fast on both flights clean airplanes nice FA fast baggage claim. Overall a pleasant experience.	1
Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth £70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!	1
Havana - Cayo Coco return. A one hour flight with an old ATR42 turboprop. Seats surprisingly comfortable and we were offered a free drink plus candy onboard. Nothing special but we arrived on time.	1
On a return journey to Dublin from Lanzarote (flight 779) I had fallen unwell 15 minutes post takeoff. The urge to throw-up a feeling not welcomed by most especially not at 30000+ altitude was overwhelming and a sense of unwanted panic set in. Luckily I was accompanied by my boyfriend whom along with the diligent and empathetic flight crew got me back on track for the remainder of the flight. Frequently asking if I was ok or whether I needed anything was a small but oh so grand gesture which made such a positive difference.	1
MAD-ATH-JMK return. The only downside is that all flights departed a minimum of 30 mins late. On the good side: check in fast and easy nice clean and comfortable aircraft. Great attentive FA food served all sectors along with drinks. Baggage short on belt after arrival. Will fly them back to Greece.	1
Rome to Athens June 23 2014. Flight was on-time comfortable seat spacing nice meal friendly and attentive staff. Would fly them again.	1
April 15th flight 108 return 26th Apr flight 105. My mother and I flew from JFK to Dublin and return. We were in economy from JFK to DUB and in Premier class on the return trip. Both were great experiences and on Aer Lingus new A330. The food was excellent in both cabins. We opted for the succulent steal ($18) in Economy and it was delicious. Crew were lovely. On return we were in the new Premier class cabin. The crew the food the service was terrific. You really could not ask for more.	1
Sunday flight 18.00 from Dublin to Heathrow. Late boarding apparently due to inbound plane being late which is odd as it arrived on time. Then the most ridiculous shambles of boarding that took forever. If people have paid for seats then they should get on first especially as some people are greedy with hand luggage and seem incapable of stowing it correctly. Finally after a good wait I got to get on the plane to find the lady on my row had blocked an entire area by putting her case in the wrong way round! Why is this not monitored? Its about time this boarding procedure was improved upon. Its the same old story. If its a full plane supervise them and get people to board both front and back!	1
Travelled with Aegean Airlines from Barcelona to Athens. Flight was delayed leaving Barcelona however still managed to arrive in Athens on time. Excellent cabin service provided by attentive and polite flight attendants. Can't complain especially with the hot meal and free alcoholic beverage provided in economy class. Wish Aegean offered long haul routes to North America!	1
"25/8/2014 A3 381 19.55 (L). I was checked in for 4A. It was impossible to see the screens which showed the ""safety briefing'"". I think the business class curtains prevented us from seeing the screen. A design problem and very important."	1
From London to Dublin. The short haul flight was on time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Ground staff at Heathrow should improve their skills. She asked me to check-in my big suitcase at the boarding gate because she could not print the luggage tag for me - it was too late. I went back to the check-in counter at the time she announced. Finally I was stopped by security due to the liquid in my big suitcase. I missed the flight and I was o/b the next flight.	1
MUC-SKG A3 503 July 22. Efficient check-in use of Lufthansa Business Class lounge (chaotic). Aircraft gate at the far end of the terminal had to walk a lot. Aircraft A320 smart neat clean. Cockpit briefing rather informative. Business class cabin crew (one flying attendant dedicated to four passengers) very satisfactory polite communicative professional. Seating pitch satisfactory - mediocre width (middle seat unoccupied - turned to table). Lavatory clean. Full satisfactory hot meal (choice of main course) with a Mediterranean accent freshly brewed espresso coffee. Actually no in flight entertainment - drop down overhead TV screens with safety instructions and flight path information. Arrived on time business class passengers departed first and transported to the terminal with a dedicated bus. Baggage (Priority labelled) were the first to arrive. Aegean airlines is rightfully voted as one of Europe's top regional airlines.	1
JIK-ATH-LHR on 11 August 2014. Return flight after week in Ikaria. Aegean flight left a few minutes late but made up time although sadly had to stack for 45 minutes at Heathrow. Excellent legroom and seat comfort. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal provided and the drinks so much more than so-called cheaper airlines. Would definitely fly Aegean again. Only downside was the failure of UK Border Agency to have sufficient staff at the immigration desks at Terminal 2.	1
We flew from Ireland with our 9 month old baby and I was 29 weeks pregnant the staff were great we had flown to Ireland with a different carrier but because of the lack of facilities for our little one we decided to let our return trip expire and book new flights with Aer Lingus there is nothing bad I can say about this airline they make you feel comfortable and were so good with our little one we were even given a bassinet for him to sleep in. I highly recommend to anyone with small children.	1
Domestic flights: Athens-Kerkira (Corfu) on a A319 aircraft and Ioannina-Athens on a Bombardier DHC-8-400Q (operated by Olympic Air). Excellent service on-time performance and very polite staff.	1
JMK-ATH-LHR. A3 377/A3 608 7 Aug 2014. Mykonos - Athens sector operated by Olympic Air Dash 800 aircraft. Clean inside and out and welcomed on board by very polite cabin crew. Only 2 Flight Attendants for a 20 minute flight. Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.	1
Flew from Rome FCO to ATH 2 hour flight but had a large selection of drinks lovely meal then tea or coffee after dinner. The staff were charming and helpful no delays at all the check in staff were informative and efficient telling us where to go with our rucksacks (apparently they're awkward shape so go in the 'oversized baggage' section). We were so efficient getting off the plane we beat our luggage to the conveyor belt. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone.	1
Madrid - Mykonos with a change of plane in Athens we left Madrid just after midnight. The plane was new and clean the service was excellent and what a treat to have a hot meal on a European flight. On leaving the plane at Athens we were told to contact the ground staff immediately as we had a very short connection time. We did so and the ground staff sent us onto the same bus as everybody else! Luckily the airport was not busy at 5 a.m. and we easily caught the flight to Mykonos. However a good very short flight to Mykonos and Aegean cannot be blamed for the ground crew. I would happily fly with them again.	1
Economy flight return from Dublin to New York. No complaints about either flight. Both departed on time. Arrival in New York as a 'domestic' passenger is a real bonus. Flight out was on an Airbus with a 2-4-2 configuration which was nice. Return flight was on a 757 with an Air Contractors Shannon based crew (according to the announcement). Seating was not as good but as it was less than 6hrs back not an issue. Entertainment channels were fine. Food served was perfectly acceptable.	1
Flights FRA-DUB return. Overall a good experience with Aer Lingus. Flights were on time seat comfort ok and staff very good. Food and drinks only for purchase but prices are fair and quality is good. Had a pre-ordered Irish breakfast on my flight to Dublin which was very good. Only minus was the cleanliness at my seat on the return flight to Frankfurt my table was full of chocolate and the window was dirty too.	1
Overall surprisingly a great experience - emphasis on the surprise. Flying Boston to Edinburgh with a layover in Dublin. Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice. For the price you really just can't beat it.	1
BUD-ATH-JTR and back with a stopover. Nice surprise! Clean new aircraft (A320/A321) and the BUD-ATH sector even had a hot meal you don't see that so much today. Had to pay for my luggage in JTR agent was very polite so no problem. Will definitely not hesitate to fly them again.	1
Flew MXP-ATH-KGS and back with Aegean in mid-May. After being used to the service quality of US flights I was pretty impressed with their service. Light meals were served on each leg of the flight the crew were friendly and though only the route map was provided as entertainment it was all I needed so I was satisfied with that as well. Would recommend this airline for people traveling to/from/within Greece.	1
DUB-JFK - December 2014. Third time flying Business with EI most flights are economy and this was a treat for our wedding anniversary. From Dublin - check in efficient lounge pleasant US immigration took minutes. Boarded first and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Crew chatty and attentive. Lovely meal and a few hours sleep on the near flat beds. I understand this year they will move to fully flat. Arrive in JFK as a domestic passenger so seamless to public transport or a cab. Flying back was excellent too. Slept most of the flight. Crew in good spirits but not as good as the crew out on the 17th (4pm flight). Overall top marks.	1
SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.	1
Flew DUB-SFO. Staff very attentive and polite. Booked Skydine well worth doing plentiful and tasty. Seats a little cramped. Blankets were not fresh! Return trip bathrooms a little tardy breakfast orange juice and snack dispensed with rather quickly by over enthusiastic young staff but will definitely use them again. Overall staff pleasant will use again.	1
EI 634 1 Jan DUB-BRU. I flew with Aer Lingus for the first time on New Year's Day and found cabin is clean with very basic in-flight facilities as no drop-down video screen buy on board food and no newspapers but departed and landed on time.	1
City break to (CDG) Paris just before Christmas. Friendly crew who handled the flight in an efficient no nonsense manner. Both legs departed and arrived in time. Approx 75% full with a mix of business leisure and Disney visitors. Buy on board food is reasonably priced and the pre-order Irish breakfast was delicious. Fare was just €100 return. Recommended.	1
Round-trip New York-Moscow in Premium Economy was excellent. No problems with /check-in, both flights were on time, cabins were clean and seats were comfortable. The crew were pleasant and helpful, food was decent but the movies available on the AVOD were rather limited. The fare I paid was very reasonable and I think the Premium Economy service is an excellent value. All in all, I was extremely satisfied with Aeroflot and definitely would fly with them again.	1
ATH-FCO 2 hours flight on time. Check-in Lounge Cabin crews all friendly and smooth operation. Complementary hot meal with pasta and soft drinks small bottle Greek wine coffee/tea. Priority luggage came out first at the FCO airport.	1
"EI 774/775 Dublin-Agadir-Dublin. Travelled 20 December - aircraft named the St Albert found the crew in both directions excellent. However the aircraft was old grubby and very tired looking it seems to be used on ""leisure"" destinations (a bit like the old charter style operations) the seat pitch is definitely narrower than their other aircraft and there was no seat pockets I'm accustomed to not having them on Ryanair and don't mind but on a 4 hour flight it's awkward. Ordered pre-order meals - they were ok I'm still not a fan of Clodagh McKennas inflight menu but it filled the gap. Unless you are in the 1st 3 rows they don't generally have much left when they come around. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my mother I wasn't surprised that on arrival Swissport who do the handling do not have any lifts to take the passengers off the flight this is a regular occurrence at Agadir out of Aer LIngus's remit I reckon. Overall Aer Lingus is continually good."	1
I often travel with Aer Lingus from Belfast City to Gatwick and have also flown to Portugal with them as well. The flights are always on time staff polite and very helpful. I'm not a fan of flying long or short journeys but I enjoy the experience with Aer Lingus.	1
The flight was OK and comfortable. The price was the best on the market and the service was amazing. The planes were clean and new and all of my flights were without any troubles. I would like to say thanks to Aeroflot and its staff.	1
FCO-SVO-NRT return trip. In Rome we found out that our flight to Tokyo was cancelled - crew on the airport wasn't very helpful, but the call centre proved to be the best solution to sort us out and we had our tickets rebooked for direct flight with Alitalia to Tokyo Narita. So the 1st leg we didn't fly with Aeroflot (if not for the call centre we would be probably stranded in Rome). The return flight on A330-300 was better than we expected - 3 or 4 yrs old aircraft with a decent amount of leg space (in comparison with Alitalia it was better), pretty good IFE and really nice food - sushi and seafood pasta which I can say was probably the best onboard meals I've ever had. SVO-FCO in A320 was also nice, good Recaro blue seats and again pretty good meals. Service wasn't smiling a lot, but was attentive and my and my group really enjoyed the flights. All in all Aeroflot exceeded expectations! would definitely recommend it (except for the airport staff in Rome which wasn't helpful at all with rebooking the ticket!).	1
I flew from Geneva to Athens in May 2014. Crew were very polite and welcoming the service was excellent for the price. I was surprised to have a full meal and to receive an alcoholic drink for free for such a low ticket price. I flew back with a low cost airline from Thessaloniki…the ticket was more expensive and of course nothing was offered to eat or drink. I was also surprised to see how fast and easy it is to upgrade in their miles and bonus program. I have already booked my next flight with them.	1
Athens - Brussels - Athens. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Good food on time.	1
LHR-ATH-RHO return. First time with Aegean. Extremely pleasant and professional staff excellent planes and comfortable seating. Not cheap but excellent airline.	1
Glasgow to Dublin on Friday returned Sunday. Booked and paid for seats at the front of the plane only to find that the only exit is at the back. Not a major issue but annoying plus a complete waste of money on what was already an expensive flight. Delay on way back as gate was late opening all kept waiting at gate in absolutely freezing conditions. Cabin staff on way out were very friendly and gave lots of great advice on shopping in Dublin.	1
LHR-DUB-LGW was pretty good both ways with the outbound being delayed and inbound arriving early. Flight staff were always very nice and welcoming. Since this was a short flight the low-cost carrier side of the airline revealed itself quite a bit. Didn't experience any problems and would definitely fly with them again.	1
Amsterdam-Moscow delayed due to special needs passengers leaving the plane in Amsterdam. Seats on the Airbus 321-200 are still real business class seats (not the common KLM-BA-Lufthansa nonsense 3-economy seats/ 2-persons space). Service is good, lunch is good (even special vegetarian meal), entertainment system is available and with a large choice. And the Russian hospitality is smiling and attentive to the guests. Had a good time on the first part of my trip. Changed planes in Moscow. Priority lane works well if the connecting flight is with Aeroflot. Moscow-Ulan Bator left on time. Seats on the Boeing 737-800 are only to be used for short distances, less than 4 hours. Mine was a medium haul flight of 6 hours. A night flight with chairs not to be used for sleeping. No real business class flat bed seat on these planes. A great pity. The service is good, dinner/breakfast is good (even the special meal for a vegetarian), entertainment system is available and with a large choice . And the Russian hospitality was once more smiling and attentive to the guests. The seats on the second flight let them down. The rest was a good experience.	1
A321 and A320 Kos - Athens / Athens - Vienna May 3 2014. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Simple and useful online check-in.	1
I recently flew Aer Lingus from Malaga to Dublin and then on to San Francisco again with Aer Lingus from Dublin the following day. I have never flown with Aer Lingus before but cannot fault either the flights or their customer service. We booked the enhanced meals on our return flights from Dublin to San Francisco and my only comment would be that although the outgoing meals were superb the incoming meals appeared to have been a little overcooked. Without exception all flights left on time and arrived early.	1
Flew EI111. Service I will admit was bad. I fly maybe 4 times a year with Aer Lingus on its European network and some people need to remember that we sadly have left the era of luxury air travel like the Great Swissair. Even flag carriers now have to cut costs. What you pay for on Aer Lingus is very cheap for the service compared to another low cost Irish airline.	1
Really an excellent new premium economy product. Almost as wide a seat as business class without the full recline. I have an allergy problem and they ran out of the meal option in premium economy that I could eat, so the attendants gave me a meal from business class. The service in premium economy was really what I would have expected in business class, constantly serving drinks and providing service. Amazing value for the money. Brand new in-flight entertainment system on the B777-300ER, same day / night destination time zone synchronization lighting (i.e. blue during the day time at destination) as is found on the new Boeing 787. Bath rooms had extra amenities, wet wipes, deodorants, and hand towels. Beyond my expectations for Premium Economy (which they reffer to as comfort class).	1
Excellent service, much better than expected. The Delhi-Moscow journey was good except for the IFE, the Moscow-New York leg was excellent. The meal served was excellent and the seats were pretty comfortable. The Moscow airport connection was a bit confusing.	1
First flight with Aegean Airlines and found it all very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful and tried to give the personal touch. From the moment we checked our bags in we found them to be really helpful. I was very nervous about the stay over and catching the next flight from ATH to RHO but they really reassured me and made sure I felt happy. On arrival in ATH they made the change of flight very stress free. Definitely use them again. So much different to Ryanair who were dreadful.	1
I was booked on an evening flight from Santorini to Athens but arrived very late and after closure of the check-in desk. I expected the worst that is to be refused boarding but I was so impressed that the Aegean staff agreed to check me in opened the check-in desk and helped me to join the other boarding passengers very efficiently. Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel. The flight itself was also very stress-free and the hostesses were polite and friendly. Very nice airline.	1
"LHR to DUB. Flew out of T2. As a Gold Circle member I used the lounge. The views and ambience is far superior to the old T1 lounge but the food is still pretty pathetic the exception being the coffee - there is a machine as well as a percolator. The flight was fine with one exception the seat pitch was incredibly tight. This is a refurbished plane with the magazine rack at eye level. I am only 5ft 4"" but I still found the space very tight."	1
October 16. Business Class Orlando to Dublin and economy class connecting to Amsterdam. It is difficult to fault this airline. The quality and attitude of the flight attendants is remarkable. This was true even on the connecting economy flight to Amsterdam despite the seating being very tight and the flight was packed. Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport. On return to Orlando in the time it took to walk for the gate to baggage Aer Lingus already had the bags on the conveyor belt. Now that's a first.	1
This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers. While I had a problem free flight, I saw a number of other passengers struggle to sort out problems with ground staff at the SVO transfer desk.	1
Good value for money, although aircraft itself is old, seats are worn out. Polite and helpfull staff on board. Ok meals.	1
Flew Hong Kong to Moscow then Moscow to London. It was okay I had read a lot of bad reviews beforehand and whilst I felt the flight attendants were perhaps not too enthusiastic the entertainment food and legroom was not bad at all. Everything went smoothly. The flight was quite low on passengers too which always makes it more comfortable.	1
"ATH-MUC in economy in March 2014 economy has the dreaded ""slimline"" seats that LH started and everyone seems to be following. That said flight crew was pleasant and professional airplane was clean flight landed on time- Aegean even gives you a snack and a drink on this flights. Pleasant experience would recommend."	1
LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.	1
"Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return."	1
BUD-SVO-NRT and back Economy class. Short haul was an A320 long one A330. All flights on time. Somewhat more legroom and comfortable seats on the A320 but they were still ok on the A330. Onboard lunch/dinner surprisingly good breakfasts/snacks kind of mixed basket. IFE on A330 had a wide enough selection of movies no music for my taste and really sluggish controls. Flight attendants helpful and nice except of the first flight BUD-SVO. I lost my itinerary Aeroflot employees at Narita helped me out. SVO terminal F really sucks but that's not the airline's fault. My first experience with Aeroflot was positive I'd rate them close to 4 stars overall and I will fly them again.	1
17/4 TLV-SVO-CAN 25/5 return. TLV-SVO B-777 excellent leg room SVO-CAN CAN-SVO SVO-TLV A-330. All planes clean with no trouble. All flights almost on time good website to book good service from staff. Meals could be better this time choice of meals has improved compared to 6 months ago.	1
Took 2 flights with Aegean Airlines in December 2013 and was truly impressed. Their quality of service was a long way ahead of British Airways that I used on 4 other flights and I will look at using Aegean Airlines again on my next trip to Europe - if Athens is on the trip list!	1
BRU to Athens on 11 Jan 2014 and flight A3622 from Athens to BRU on 15 Jan 2014. First time experience with Aegean Airlines was very pleasurable from good online check-in mobile boarding card on time departures friendly patient cabin crew and service oriented ground staff.	1
My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos.	1
I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.	1
Kerry-Dublin-Kerry on 14th October. Flight is Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air. Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry. Food was dreadful - a rock hard scone from 'Clodagh's Kitchen'. Not Clodagh's best bake! These are relatively minor though easily resolved quibbles in what is a very useful service.	1
Used the BHX-DUB flight taking about an hour and just wanted to say what a pleasant experience it was compared to the competition on this route. No check-in queue or problems even though I was late due to a delayed train. A relaxed and pleasant experience throughout. No being herded onto stairwells so that the airline can stick to its tight schedules - just walked straight onto the plane after a short wait. The plane itself was a newish ATR 72-600 with an easy-on-the-eye light grey/blue interior - not the oppressive yellow and blue of the competition. Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1. A relaxing experience and good all round - well worth the extra few euros (although actually cheaper than FR for this particular trip).	1
We recently flew Aer Lingus from Chicago to Dublin and we can now say that we have a new favorite airline. Flights were on time luggage problems were non-existent and the staff was great.	1
ARN-SVO-BKK return on new A320 and B773. Flights more or less on time. No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy. If a bit better food - and maybe a bit better English for some staff Aeroflot could easily be a 4 star airline.	1
Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.	1
AEP-MTV short 30 min flight. Check in at aeroparque was fast no lines for security line. Boarding by bus 20 min delay no explanation given. Once on board nice FA nice service and arrival nearly on time. Bags short on belt. Good option on this route.	1
Flight BHI-AEP-BHI August 2014 with Aerolineas Argentinas. A domestic flight both of only 1 hour. Crew were friendly and polite. Catering service was just OK. Aircraft were old but still comfortable (both B737). Both flights on time.	1
I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.	1
The flight from JFK to DUB was good the food was very nice however the entertainment is very lacking compared to other carriers - old choices and not a big selection. On the return trip the cabin was freezing and delayed by an hour food wasn't good on way back and entertainment was the same.	1
Flew LHR to SVO 27/3/15 returned 4/4/15. Outbound A321 return A330-300. Both trips were comfortable with cabin crew all very helpful and pleasant to a non Russian Speaker. We were in economy both ways. The plane was clean the toilets were fine and the food and drinks provided were good for airline food in our family experience. Overall a very pleasant experience No IFE on way out as small plane but lots on way back choice was good.	1
I flew Aeroflot with a connection in Moscow. On my 10 hour long flights we were served two meals! The food was very good considering it was airline food. It was hot with plenty of bread and salad. Free wine was served throughout the flight. We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck. The smaller airbus for my 4 hour flight to Venice did not have any entertainment video but did serve a meal. I recommend Aeroflot as great airline for the price! Was totally surprised.	1
First time flying with Aegean Airlines from FRA to ATH on a Lufthansa codeshare and couldn't be happier. Nice to have inflight infotainment on a short haul flight and not bad food better than Air Canada. No delays on time and cabin crew were nice. Only downside was that there was no seat-back monitors which many airliners are upgrading to and seats are sort of stiff.	1
ATH-ROM-ATH. Great airline with great service and great staff. The trip was perfect despite the bad weather.	1
I have now been flying with Aegean since they took over the Olympic slots at Heathrow. This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.	1
"AR 1303 April 23rd and AR 1302 April 26th. We were looking for a reasonable Business Class fare from Miami to Buenos Aires we were amazed at how much less expensive Aerolineas was than the other carriers that we checked and were worried that it might be due to an inferior flight experience but decided that since were only flying down for three days to attend a wedding he had to go for it. Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers. I would fly Aerolineas again."	1
We flew business class (club condor) from JFK on Feb 21 and returned on Feb 28. Great experience. Airbus 330-200 was clean and comfortable. Both flights left on time. Crews were first-rate. Great bargain. Highly recommend it.	1
Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.	1
Booking experience is horrific. We've flown with this airline 8 times this year and each time there are many mistakes in the booking process. Their website is worse than useless it throws a litany of errors and seemingly holding parts of your information input which confounds the website next time you access it. This last booking it lost seat reservations and despite many emails are unable to get a simple request like sitting together right. They charge for meals and don't provide them. Onboard all is well nice friendly staff on clean planes. Food is just acceptable. Best way is take your own and have a picnic. All our flights have been on time. Avoiding massive queues on arrival in US having immigration in Dublin makes flying to the US better than any other route. Advice? Book early and be prepared for a slow process.	1
Manchester-Athens Oct 2013. Boarding and landing was 20 minutes delayed. Very comfortable seats and excellent staff. Food was really good and you could choose from a variety of drinks. Overall a very good flying experience. The only thing i would like to stress is the lack of any entertainment. I don't know if it is so expensive to show a movie during the flight especially when the screens are available! An airline like Aegean should at least have some kind of entertainment for long flights.	1
My wife and I flew from Rome to Athens and Athens to Paris recently check in was a breeze and both flights were great. No problems at all.	1
We flew 3 times with this airline and all flights were great even though there were delays (up to 20 minutes ) all arrivals were on time . The first flight from Kiev to Athens the plane was a brand new Airbus A320 leather seats in the cabin and very comfortable. Take-off and landing were perfect the staff were normal. For food I do not intend to complain on a flight less than 3 hours. In general we were impressed with this airline and we can recommend it.	1
December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.	1
MAD-SVO-HKG return in Economy. Perfect trip Aeroflot is trying its best to be equally competitive with its European rivals and quite manages it. The only drawback is a horrible SVO connection. Unnecessary crowded passport controls for transit passengers Horrible terminal F. Otherwise would definitely fly with them again.	1
LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service. Check in at LHR and RHO easy and quick. Baggage delivery prompt. All in all very pleasant.	1
For this short 100 min flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires the economy seat on the 737-700 had plenty leg room and they even served a small lunch box which impressed me. Just beware that row 6 which was behind me has no window. I would not want to be in that seat!	1
Flew on Oct 21st from Ezeiza to Miami on AR 1304. Equipment was Airbus 330-200. Traveled in Business Class (Seat 5d) Check in service was very friendly and efficient. Business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff. Boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin. Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle; very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video. Unfortunately the only WC in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories. Not good.	1
We travelled from the Boston US to Ireland on an emergency trip. We flew on August 21 and returned today Sept. 5. Staff were excellent on both flights. We are traveling again in December and we look forward to much of the same. This was a short notice flight so it was a little pricey.	1
Bangkok to London Heathrow via Moscow. After reading mixed reviews thought this could be a nightmare when in actual fact the service was good. Friendly staff flights on time online check in and seat reservation a breeze at Bangkok you can check in at self service terminal - saves a lot of queuing. Very convenient print boarding card fast bag drop new planes and great prices the food served was not big portion sizes but was tasty standard economy airline food no alcohol served on the BKK to Moscow leg but plenty of soft drinks - water juices etc which came round every hr or so. Moscow airport: I read loads of negative reviews terminal F is old and not great but D  E where most international flights depart from are modern Burger king TGI Fridays etc loads of retail outlets prices same as all airports. I also read its a nightmare to transit between terminals when in fact its not it is a long walk between them but no problem. One security check one passport check. I have to say some staff look very stern but they are actually very friendly. There is no smoking in all terminals. All in all I would fly with them again based on price and service I received.	1
I flew from SGN to SVO on Dec 25 2014. Very good food good leg room. 1 bag late and delivered to hotel. Overall very good I will use them whenever possible.	1
Moscow-Warsaw 18 Dec. Pros: nice new clean Airbus aircraft with leather seats and decent legroom. Flight on time. Very smart looking attractive cabin crew. Good English so all announcements were understandable ( quite rare with Aeroflot). Cons: service downgraded rapidly since last month's flight I took with them. This time only small sandwich and water/coffee/tea offered - nothing else (last time was tray with meal cake and whole selection of soft drinks). EU restrictions I suppose. Cabin crew very official and robotic absolutely no personal touch no interaction - beautifully groomed but cold and serious. Inflight magazine thick and full of good articles but in Russian only (literally last 4 pages were in English only) which is pity as it looks very interesting.	1
ATH-HER-ATH connecting to Swiss ZRH-ATH-ZRH. Short 50 min flight on a A321. Flight completely full however the friendly crew managed to serve the whole plane drinks and peanuts. Very comfortable seats sufficient legroom. All in all very enjoyable. Would choose Aegean again.	1
ATH-PRG-ATH. All flights were smooth and on time. Check-in in Athens and Prague airport was fine and not too long. The seats on board the aircraft's were comfortable better than other airlines and the legroom was good. Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs. Overall Aegean Air is a very good airline as it claims to be. I would fly again with them if I have a chance. Too bad they don't fly long haul routes but they only fly regional routes.	1
I flew from JFK to EZE on October 2/14. The flight left on time and arrived on time. I travelled in Club Condor. The service was friendly and efficient. New A330 aircraft. The Club Condor seat was an inclined flat seat. I found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable. I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good. There were a lot of movies to chose from. There were several places to charge my devices. I would fly with Aerolineas again.	1
Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.	1
Montevideo-Aeroparque-Asunción. I have to say that there is an improvement in the service. Still there are delays and poor customer service on the ground. But on board there are new and comfortable planes and nice and attentive FA. Connecting in Aeroparque (Buenos Aires city airport) is always fast and easy. First leg delayed connection on time. Bags arrived at my destination with me.	1
My wife and I flew AeroMexico for the first time this past June. We didn't know what to expect but were extremely pleased. The planes we flew to and from Cancun were new and clean. Screens at every seat. Great service from staff. kicker is that I somehow managed to lose my iPhone on the way back home. I thought it must have been at the Cancun Airport so I called them a few times to check the lost and found. Nothing. Then about three days after my flight I got a call from AeroMexico that they had discovered my phone on the plane. I hadn't even informed them that it was missing because I checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there. Honestly I don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was. They may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane. Anyway I went back to the airport and remarkably, they had my phone. I was relieved and extremely impressed. Needless to say I would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying to/from Mexico. And they are linked to Delta so I believe your points will accrue as Skymiles.	1
YYZ to DUB to EDI return. Transatlantic flights were excellent good IFE system pleasant staff and acceptable food. Big problem was connection in Dublin long walk through terminal and had to clear security again even though we were in the flight connection route. This does not happen at Heathrow so not sure why Dublin can't fix it. We were running to make the Toronto flight as security had only 1 of 3 lanes open.	1
I took a flight from Netherlands to New Delhi via Moscow airport dated 16th December. I read all the reviews and statistics to check the possibility of any flight cancellation. Most of the reviews were negative but the stats were sound showing there were not significant delays. I was primarily hoping for 2 things 1). On time flight 2). Safe arrival of luggage. The flight from Amsterdam airport to Moscow (2 hours time) didn't had inflight entertainment. The other flight from Moscow to New Delhi (6 hours 20 minutes duration) had good inflight entertainment system. The quality of food was OK was not at its best. There were no delays in the connecting flights. I had to board from Terminal E to Terminal F which was nearby some 700 meters walking distance. However there were some issues with Moscow Airport - i). To my wonder the security staff was missing and the passengers had to wait for odd 20 minutes. They came scanned the handbags and put stamp on 'boarding pass' ii). the mini trolleys which are otherwise freely available on Amsterdam airport were simply unavailable. The passengers carrying hand bags had to face difficulty in rushing between terminals iii). The sign boards in Moscow airport are not mountedpositioned at appropriate locations. The travelers sometimes have to take U turn to go the correct direction.	1
"Boeing 777 from Moscow to Hanoi: good leg space comfortable chair excellent inflight entertainment with many new movies tv-series. The food was average but not bad. They serve wine (ok quality) but no beer. After dinner the flight attendants ""disappear"" but react quickly to the calling light."	1
Airbus 320 from Moscow to Brussels: good leg space comfortable chair but a bit cramped in the 3-3 layout. No inflight entertainment but luckily only a 4 hours flight. Food average but ok. They serve wine (not bad) but no beer.	1
We flew from Athens to Rhodes 2 weeks ago fantastic airline short flight had sweets and soft drinks plenty of leg room.	1
Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!	1
Plane left late, but the staff tried to do their best. The space between seats was good so the trip was confortable. There was no option for the menu, and the taste was not the best, but time passed away and we arrived with no more troubles	1
LHR - Shannon A319 - Aer Lingus bought these aircraft from Portugal and promised to reconfigure the seating but have not done so. Seat rows after 9 are extremely uncomfortable for any one over average height. Flight crew were aware of this but according to discussions multiple customer complaints have not had any impact. Select a forward row for comfort.	1
Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.	1
"I flew HKG-SVO-LED and back in the past week. The seats were really comfortable on both legs; however legroom could be improved (I'm 5""8) and it was pretty cramped in the A330-300 however on the A320 the legroom was sufficient. Food was really good compared with other airlines and I was quite satisfied with Aeroflot's service. On the last flight from SVO-HKG that I took today all economy passengers received medium-haul amenity kits from Business class which was surprising as there was only a pair of slippers and eye-shades on the first leg. Overall I really enjoyed the flight and I'll definitely be taking Aeroflot again in the near future!"	1
BRU-ATH ATH-BRU. Jul 20 2013 and Aug 11 2013. Aegean always exceeds expectations. Attentive and courteous cabin crew clean aircraft and comfortable seats. Above and beyond!	1
RHO-ATH-FCO. This should be listed as a 4-star airline. Clean new planes excellent meals featuring Greek items and the most courteous FA's I have encountered in years. A pleasure to fly!	1
Athens to London Heathrow with A321. Very clean aircraft very helpful crew and tasty food. Very nice take off and landing.	1
AEP-MDZ MDZ-AEP in a new embraer. Really satisfied with the service. A small beverage offered with some 'alfajores' to eat. Nice trip in both ways and both legs on time. Really impressed by improvement of Aerolineas compared with its competitors in Europe. Small entertainment offered with Argentinean music videos and TV shows. Fantastic.	1
Check-in was fast. Our plane was  comfortable. Each traveler had access to a touchscreen tv. We were able watch movies, tv shows, music videos and listen to music. They also provided croissant sandwich along with snacks and drinks. We arrived on time and without any problems. Thank you Aeromexico for your excellent service.	1
I was more worried about the baggage fees than the airline, come to find out that Aeromexico allows 1 carry on and first checked bag for free up to 50 pounds. The plane that we took from Dallas to Mexico City was a nice plane, 2 seater instead of 3, they served us a Ham and Cheese croissant, peanuts, juice, water, beer, liqour, whatever we wanted. Smooth ride, nice landing, made it to Mexico City, from there we took a bigger plane but a little bit older, still a smooth ride and landing. On the way back from Cancun we were in a very nice plane with our own TV, headphones, several movies to choose from. My experience flying with Aeromexico was really good, nothing to complain about.	1
We flew from Stockholm to Moscow in July. Short 2 hour flight on a new A320 not the old Soviet era planes I was expecting which was good. Flight attendants well groomed spoke barely little English but were helpful enough. Didn't have any of the food because it was a short flight. Plane left and arrived on time Aeroflot was fine for a quick short haul flight no complaints. Moscow airport on the other hand.	1
The thought of spending a total of 17 hours on Aeroflot and 10 hours in SVO between flights was somewhat frightening. The stay at SVO was as bad as anticipated. However the two Aeroflot flights much exceeded expectations spotlessly clean very new planes decent food better than expected IFE excellent service. The price was right.	1
Fantastic service in business from MUC to SKG. Full service on a 1.5hr flight with many choices. Please change your seats in business class this is a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked. Not comfortable in comparison for what you pay.	1
I took 3 domestic flights (Aeroparque-Salta Menodza-Bariloche in Y and Bariloche-Aeroparque in C-Class) with Aerolineas Argentinas in the last 3 weeks. Each flight was leaving and arriving on time the crew were nice though not all of the crew members spoke English. The snacks as well as the drinks offered were rather boring but free of charge. The planes were comfortable enough for the short flights especially the brand new Embraer of Air Austral with IFE in each seat were great!	1
Aeromexico has recently restarted its flights to Toronto, I had a nice experience flying with them that started with a half price sale ticket. I thought that having bought my ticket so cheaply and being in the lowest cabin class, the flying experience would not be very good, but I was surprised by the kind attention of the stewardesses and also by a tasty breakfast in the morning. Only flaws in the flight was that the flight arrived half an hour late, maybe due to turbulance, the seats are a bit uncomfortable and the audio did not work, but as it is a 5 hours night flight only, that did not bother me much.	1
My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again. The moderate inconvenience of transferring in Dublin was worth it to save at least £200 pounds each on a direct flight.	1
"Like I indicated below - nothing but excellent. Flew from LAX to Mokba and back. Very outstanding service. Check in easy quick and efficient. The food flying back from Mokba was very good. Sat in the first row right were the bathrooms are and was very impressed how ALL flight attendants were constantly checking and cleaning the bathrooms (our American airlines should really take notice of that. Their bathrooms are not clean - to say the least). Also the flight stats are throughout the whole flight very nicely displayed - including nearest towns at what direction and distance - never saw that with our airlines. It also shows ""pilot view"" of take-off and landing - loved that. Actually could recognize all people on the ground shortly before touch down watching the descending airplane at LAX with flashes going off like crazy. In the future I will try to book Aeroflot wherever available."	1
Omsk - St Petersburg. Flew this sector 10 days after surgery and was pleased with the flights. No real express check in but express lane for security and a lounge in Omsk. Good food on both flights and comfortable space. No inflight entertainment - I had my own and the both flights on time. Luggage was amongst the first off in St Petersburg (a big plus given a transit in Moscow). Cabin crew spoke good English (again a noticeable improvement over the past few years). Aeroflot seems to be the best of the Russian Airlines.	1
Flew London Heathrow to Athens and back. Great cabin crew very friendly. Food is rather good (for airline food)! Beverage service is excellent. Enjoyed the extra legroom and the leather seats.	1
DUS to ATH and 4 days later from ATH to HER. Both flights on time very quick check-in and boarding. Very friendly and attentive efficient staff good service excellent melas even for the short hub from ATH to HER. It will remain our preferred carrier to and from Greece.	1
Dramatic improvement - would use them again. They have obviously spent a lot of money over the past 3 years on new planes with in-flight entertainment. Service was friendly and our flights on time (AEP-SCL).	1
"Flew 2 legs- MID-MEX on ""Connect"" brand and then MEX-YYZ. The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn't important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you're flying an Aeromexico 737. In flight meal was edible at most. Overall there were no major problems but they need to improve their IFE on longer flights and their food."	1
Flight 9100 and 9101 coach seating 4/3 to 4/7/15. I cannot say enough good things about or flight service through Aeromexico. The planes were clean and very comfortable loved having the option of watching a movie TV show or listening to music. The attendants were friendly and took care of us all very well. Lunch boxes were served - that's a pleasant surprise in itself! I was very impressed!	1
"Sunday 22nd February - Mexico City to LAX - Premier Class. Old aircraft with ""drop down"" shared TV screens. Service and food could not be faulted on board the aircraft. Bags did not arrive in LAX - the check in staff in Mexico City had incorrectly tagged my two bags to a flight to Miami. Long story short the bags arrived in Sydney two days later thanks to a very attentive customer service officer in the USA. Ground staff at LAX could have shown a little more empathy with my situation."	1
I use to fly with Ryanair back and forth from Dublin every few weeks. After Ryanair changed their flight times to Dublin which did not help me I changed to Aer Lingus. The staff are friendly and always smiling the planes are comfortable and the times of the flights are fantastic. The prices are always a little higher than the other company's but I would not change back.	1
My family and I flew from Moscow to Istanbul Ataturk in economy class. For the money is not expensive. The plane for this flight was a brand new A320 with sharklets. Unfortunately without a TV. The dinner was nice. Cabin crew with beauty red uniform were always respectful cheerful and ready to help. Pilots masters of their craft. Like for duty-free sales on board. All in all a great experience. Would definitely recommend and travel with them again.	1
Flight from MAD to Shanghai with transfer in Moscow. Good airline in general terms. Meals as other alternatives but no alcohol served. Seats and leg room are OK. They offer Space + seats located in the emergency exists and prices are reasonable. Cabin crew no friendly enough from my point of view if I compare with other airlines to flight to China like BA Finnair or AF. The main difference is that they provide slippers and eye masks no offered by other airlines. Cabin and toilets are clean enough. Moscow airport is awful and really boring. Distances between terminals and gates are too much long. Flights arrived on time. Entertainment system only in English and Russian. Music selection is OK.	1
Prague to Athens. Nice A320 good crew. However its standards are far below under its competitor - Czech Airlines.	1
DXB-IKA. A300-600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor.	1
Flew from LHR thru MEX to PVR. Was my first time on the Dreamliner. It's a beautiful aircraft and the AeroMexico service and comfort the best I've experienced in long-haul tourist class. Formalities and connection at MEX Term 2 very efficient. Domestic flight to PVR on very comfortable Embraer 190.	1
AM 681. Flew YUL-MEX on a new 737-800 for the second time. Cabin was in great condition. Food service on this flight was much better than on my previous flights with Aeromexico in Clase Premier. Cabin crew were excellent and very professional. The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards. This was not the case in this flight when there was always a flight attendant in the cabin (even in economy class). Great flight overall wish all crews performed this way.	1
Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. If we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer.	1
"I flew Aeroflot 4 times over the last 15 days. From HK to Moscow Moscow to UK UK to Moscow Moscow home. The first leg was ""bearable"" if a little short on snacks and food options - so much so that the first thing I did was to buy a little bag of peanuts to go in my carry on. The second leg was uncomfortable due to the shell seats which are nothing sort of a torture device. Two weeks pass before the third leg which was same seats same limited choice of movies and even the same food. The fourth leg - the entertainment system took around an hour to load. Same movies even though it was a different month! But the real issue for me was the meal. With almost every meal they serve 2 pieces of bread. The white ""loaf"" is always icy cold and hard. The little brown slice was also cold and hard. There was not enough butter for both. Given the price I paid for my ticket I didn't expect gourmet food but the piece of salmon was literately the size of a teaspoon. The chicken was barely warm. Usually the food is served piping hot and even if the bread is not heated if you leave your roll on top of your main meal you can get a bit of heat and steam into it. No such luck. The dessert - there was nothing to eat it with in the utensil pack was exactly what it looked like tasteless overly sweet faux cream. Breakfast I chose the pancakes which I was unable to eat they were far too sweet. I was pretty hungry by the time we landed."	1
RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.	1
The flight departed from CDG just a little bit late. But the service was extremely good. Served pasta drinks and hot bread. 3hrs flying time. On time arrival in Athens. Air fare was rather fair.	1
Flew ATH-DME-ATH. The entire experience from check-in to landing was superb. Clean aircraft with decent seat comfort kind and smiley flight attendants. Both flights on time. They served a hot meal which was good enough and they served cold  hot drinks like 5 times during the flights. Overall a great experience.	1
Two flights from Milan Malpensa to Athens both on time both on the airbus A320. Staff very kind. Fresh food was good but I'd rather have something hot. The aircraft was very clean. The onboard magazine was good and interesting written in Greek and in English.	1
I flew from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then to Bogota with Aerolineas Argentinas last week and then returned the same way a few days later. The aircraft appeared very new and I have absolutely no complaints about seats or bathroom or cleanliness. The food was as good as any I have had on Qantas and the staff were as good or nearly so.	1
I took three flights in November. Buenos Aires (AEP) to Cordoba Cordoba to Mendoza and Mendoza to Buenos Aires (AEP). They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points. I was a little apprehensive after reading the comments here but in my case the flights all left close to on time and the aircraft were nearly new. Seating was comfortable and space was adequate. On each flight there was a beverage service and small snack box.	1
I have been using Aeromexico for several years for business travel from Chicago to various locations throughout Mexico. They have multiple direct flights. I have been happy with their service both at the counter at the gate and on the airplane. The planes seem to be maintained well and bathrooms and seating areas are clean. Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements. The food to me just seems to be a little better the service a bit more professional and the areas cleaner than everyone else. Again much of what one views is based on perceptions and a few negative things can color one's view. In my case I see so many small positive things that it has probably colored my view of Aeromexico in a good way.	1
AM 423 Nov 27 2014. AM 422 Dec 2 2014. I have flown from Miami to Mexico and back many times. For several years I made the trip once a month. I have flown on every airline that services Mexico City from Miami. AeroMexico beats them all. Basic friendliness refreshments and snacks prompt departures and arrivals reasonable and competitive fares all without the ubiquitous add-ones and charges of other airlines. I will adjust my schedule to fly this airline every time. This trip was the first in several years and it didn't disappoint. Keep it up I'm a big fan.	1
Dublin to San Francisco return. Outward journey via Boston (second leg with Jetblue which was great) as the direct flight was sold out for days around my date of travel. Thankfully got one of the last seats on the direct flight on the return journey. Business class wasn't in the budget for this trip but the seats in economy were fine (I'm 6'0'' tall). I ordered one of the special meals for the Boston flight which was well worth it had the regular meal from SFO to DUB which was fine and you could help yourself to drinks and snacks from the galley at any time. The service is consistent the aircraft's always immaculate the personal entertainment has plenty of choice and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. You can select most seats on the aircraft for free at time of booking. Lets hope AL go daily on this route in 2015.	1
DUB-LHR LHR-DUB check in at T2 Dublin a breeze. Quiet flight on the way out got away early nice friendly and attentive cabin crew for the short flight. More or less the same on the way back but T1 at Heathrow looking tired. Although I'm happy to use Aer Lingus again in the near future and will be great to see the end of T1 at Heathrow when they move to the new terminal!	1
Moscow to Berlin in business. Check-in was a breeze with a smile. Lounge at SVO pretty decent. Seats on A-320 great and greeted with choice of drinks including champagne. Cabin crew very friendly and spoke good English. I speak some Russian and was treated always with smile. Lunch very tasty. Beats Lufthansa Business any day. Captain did three announcement with good English. Flight on time would highly recommend Aeroflot on European flights anytime.	1
It was my first flight with Aeroflot from LAX to Rome Italy through Moscow. It was a very pleasant flight and definitely will fly them again. The flight was on time the food excellent FA's were very polite and in Moscow City Aeroport Sheremetyevo the accommodation was superb. There is a Capsule hotel on 3rd floor and for 4 hours $103 we got a nice clean room with comfortable beds and a bathroom.	1
Will try my best to be objective since our luggage have not arrived (even a week later). TLV-SVO-CAN and back May/June 2014. Short leg - B-777-300 excellent seats and room. Long leg: SVO-CAN 10 hrs. A-330-300 excellent seats and room. Return flight: CAN-SVO A-330 and Short leg: A-330-300 the seats were cramped. Crew on all flights were very nice and efficient. Food was boring you get 2 meals on the long legs however they were almost the same. Flights were almost on time and inflight entertainment normal.	1
ATH to RHO on an A320-200. Boarding and take-off a bit late but nevertheless it arrived as expected to Rhodes airport. Cabin was clean and shinny and the crew very friendly and looking elegant in their (well designed) uniforms. Seats fairly comfortable and all leather dressed even in economy. One thing I don't like in Aegean aircraft cabins is the seat-plan which makes the cabin feel a bit crowded in fully booked flights. Snack and drink ok nothing special for a short flight but ok. Flight was nice and smooth landing was great. Overall a pleasant and comfortable flight. I think Aegean's reputation as a quality European airline is well deserved.	1
FRA-SKG in Economy operated by Aegean Airlines. Bit fussy boarding at FRA and slightest delay due to late incoming aircraft. Shiny new cabin on A320-200 attentive and welcoming staff. Overhead monitors for safety instructions and a flight show. Brilliant hot meal on 2 hour flight accompanied by appetizer (warm roll/butter/mini crackers/spread cheese) and selection of Greek wines in little bottles (not by glass) a dessert and two rounds of very decent coffee. Smooth landing on time. Absolutely recommended.	1
Flew Austral economy from Sao Paulo-Buenos Aires-Mendoza-Santiago. All in EMB190 jets. Only the Mendoza to Santiago flight were on time. Service was ok and the seats were quite comfortable with a good pitch.	1
JFK to CUN 10/8/14 flight 417. Return flight 416 on 10/16/14. Excellent airline. Starting from check in all associates were friendly and helpful. Personal entertainment in the seat backs was perfect. 1st checked bag free is always appreciated. Food was great and also a bonus as it was served at no charge and with smiling associates. Aeromexico is a new favorite airline of mine.	1
I had never flown AeroMexico prior to my first visit to Mexico in October/November 2014. I was impressed that they have a new modern fleet comprising 777s and the 787 Dreamliner. The check in process at the counters in Mexico City was very expedient and friendly. The boarding and departure were timeous. The service onboard for the quick domestic flight to Oaxaca was super friendly and cheerful. I cannot fault this airline. It was a better experience than most domestic airlines I fly in Australia.	1
Have taken Aer Lingus from the US (Chicago and NY) several times and am very impressed. The planes are new the seats reasonably comfortable (good leg room and we are tall people) the food fine and good selections on the personal TV/Movie screens. No problems with being on time staff was friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed when we got into Dublin a bit late and were personally escorted through the lines in order to make our connection on to Paris. Never had that happen with any airline before! I would fly Aer Lingus again.	1
BRU-DUB. I am regular flyer on this route normally on 10.20am flights. What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.	1
"EI3281. More often than not late leaving Bristol for. dublin. The walk to passport is so long - really is there no where closer to ""park""? Should have landed 35 minutes ago and still not parked up."	1
First-time with Aeroflot. Stuttgart/STR to St. Petersburg/LED via Moscow-Sheremetyevo/SVO. Both on-time. From STR to SVO the plane was an A320 and from SVO to LED the plane was A321. The seats were very comfortable and the leg room was impressive! I am 178cm/5'10 and after sat down there was about 15cm/6in in front of my knees. In fact you can put one leg on the other without any problems. I often fly Lufthansa from Germany to Russia and in Lufthansa's A320/321 economy cabin you definitely do not see this much leg space. The food was fine. STR-SVO includes a full lunch and two rounds of drink service and SVO-LED includes a teriyaki chicken sandwich and drinks. The staffs were professional and spoke adequate amount of English. The captains of the flights each made 3 announcements in English (welcome in-flight update and a final goodbye after landing) which were quite impressive. Overall I found the trip very pleasant and Aeroflot's has exceeded my expectations! I can see clearly Aeroflot wants to improve and they are making a good effort!	1
Flew Moscow - Hong Kong (Return) on Aeroflot's A330-300. Both flights were great. Aeroflot has really stepped up their game. Both flights perfectly on-time. New aircraft fresh IFE (movies TV shows games - lots to choose from) friendly staff. Legroom could be an inch better but it seems that the rows to the back of the aircraft are worse. Food was unimaginative but edible. The crew could speak a little better English but it was sufficient. SVO airport is horrible though.	1
Flew SU2585 and SU1860 (LHR VIA SVO TO EVN). First leg was on an A321. Sufficent leg room and liked the fact the toilets were in the middle of the cabin. Food was average but I had eaten before boarding. Staff were friendly/professional and spoke English. Second leg was on an A320. Leg room was even better. Food was better than the first legs and staff once again were professional but English was limited. No IFE on either sector. I would use Aeroflot again if the fare was more competitive.	1
JTR-ATH-DME. Both times there were new A320s with comfortable seats and adequate entertainment - magazines music overhead TV screens. First flight departed with a slight delay - 10 mins but arrived on time. On this 45 mins flight the cabin crew served a cookie and all kinds of napkins (dry and refreshing) but surprisingly didn't offer any drink at all. The next flight was also on time. The catering was tasty with meat little salad and baklava. Drinks of various kinds were offered. Both times the cabin crew was smiley but didn't show much care. Baggage arrived quickly. It was also very convenient to transfer through ATH. I would recommend Aegean Airlines.	1
Flight ATH-HER-ATH. Slightly delayed (about 15 min delay in boarding/arrival times - both ways). New aircraft very clean with nice seats. Legroom more than good for a 50 min flight Overall I would recommend flying with this airline.	1
Flew Sydney - Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires - Sydney. Pros: Staff helpful. Good value for money. Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken. Food is average they serve just 2 meals in a long flight so take some with you during the flight. Old airplane and does not have entertainment system. You need to take a tablet with you - they don't allow phones even in airplane mode. Flights delayed.	1
Rio de Janeiro to Montevideo via Buenos Aires and return via Buenos Aires and Iguazu to Rio. Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well. Their spoken English is awful if I didn't speak Spanish I wouldn't understand a word of what they announced.	1
I really think this airline is sadly overlooked in the US market. I took a chance on them a few years back when United dropped direct flights to places in Mexico I visit and found an airline with great service modern planes and competitive prices. The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning. In the past 3 years I have flown with them 10+ times and have no interest in looking elsewhere.	1
1 Oct 2014  San Antonio TX - Mexico City Mexico. Mexico City Mexico - Oaxaca Mexico. I live in Oaxaca and fly regularly to San Antonio to visit family in Texas. I have found the staff particularly patient helpful and courteous with my struggles to speak Spanish. My flights have been on time and the planes clean and pleasant. One trip my connection in DF was tight and the attendant booked me on the later flight in case I missed the one I was ticketed for.	1
Flew from JFK to Shannon then Heathrow on June 7/8 then from Gatwick to Dublin to JFK on June 22. My husband is a retired Air Traffic Controller and said we were flying Aer Lingus or Icelandair only so we flew Aer Lingus. Loved it! The stewards were very nice and the crew were funny even in announcements. We did not upgrade the meal but they were great except on the way back I asked for the beef dish and she gave me the chicken which had curry and I can't eat curry. After finally getting her to stop and listen they were out of beef. I slept most the way anyway.	1
TLV-SVO and SVO-RIX. TLV-SVO was on a new A330. As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints. Would take Aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other European carriers.	1
LHR-SVO return. Both flights on new and clean A330-300 though seats a bit hard and less comfortable than their A320/321 fleet. Chicken curry on flight to SVO and lamb on return flight and both quite nice. Flight attendants did not smile a lot but were professional. IFE very good with dozens of latest films and music. One thing that could be improved and that's the headphones : they do not give ear cushions and so wearing headphones is very uncomfortable even painful to ears sometimes. The sound quality is also terrible. Quite a pleasant experience on both flights and I will use Aeroflot again. For 250 which is an almost EasyJet price you get a full service package IFE and SkyPriority for a 3 hour flight.	1
SVO to MUC and back. Two-hour delay of the flight from Moscow due to military parade and air space closure - no fault of the airline. But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.	1
LHR-LCA-LHR economy. Superb inflight service three servings of drinks and appetizing hot meals. Punctuality good. Cabin crew courteous smiling and pro-active.	1
Cyprus to Athens on Aegean. An excellent flight and a great service. The staff are great and very friendly. Food was also nice. Only downside was check in which had a long queue.	1
Tucuman-Buenos Aires-Tucuman. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed on time and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew very friendly. Totally recommended.	1
The saying that you get what you pay for is spot on when it comes to Aerolineas. Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok. The flight back however took off 2.5 hours late and then stopped in Patagonia with no explanation as to why so all up the journey took over 18 hours instead of 13.	1
"Flew return MIA-EZE and was a bit worried after reading the post. Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the ""new"" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin. All in all I still think they were an OK airline if you had no other choice."	1
Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.	1
Flights from San Antonio to Cuernavaca then back to Atlanta were most pleasant experiences. All the things I like to have happen when flying came together on both flights. Both were on time check in went quickly and smoothly every Aeromexico person I had contact with was professional and friendly and even boarding was quick and efficient. The meals - sandwich and candy bar - was well a sandwich but the bread was fresh and a fun sized Snickers isn't all that bad. This was my second and third flight with Aeromexico and all were very pleasant flights. I caught up on a TV show going down and a movie coming back home. For me the airline did a great job and the fare was very reasonable.	1
Flight 24. Departed at 11.55pm on Oct 20 and arrived at 12.30pm on Oct 21. Had a very positive experience with my flights to and from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro in Premiere Class. From the gate agents to the inflight crew the service was excellent. The meals and entertainment was also very good.	1
MEX/PVR morning flight. Check-in staff forgot to put a priority tag on my luggage. Even 70min flight Business class meal was only one muffin same as Economy class. The only different thing was refilling coffee. Seat was enough big but old. It's ok because of a short haul but if it's more than 2 hours I take Economy class to save money.	1
Flew BRS-DUB-YYZ then YQG-YYZ-DUB-BRS in June 2014 as it was convenient to fly from our home airport rather than drive to London for a direct flight. Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.	1
A comfortable flight crew were pleasant but not much seat room. A little costly compared to other airlines with no direct flight from Toronto to London. Baggage amount was reduced to regional amount on way back to Toronto as we flew from Newcastle yet it was International amount from Dublin to London didn't make sense.	1
Quick check in boarding and departure on time. We had a light dinner. I have travelled with Aegean many times and I think that on SKG-STR route they should improve catering and entertainment. Staff very friendly.	1
Paris/CDG-Athens on A321 aircraft. Wonderful service in economy class although flight was delayed for almost 3 hours due to very bad weather conditions (heavy snow). Cabin crew was one of the best I have met on a flight. Meals in Y/C need some improvement.	1
We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.	1
BRU-JNB-BRU with a stopover in Tripoli. There were some troubles with the in-flight entertainment. On our way to JNB there were not enough headsets so we couldn't use the inflight entertainment. On our way back from JNB to Tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didn't work at all. The food was okay and the cabin crew friendly. It's definitely value for money but there are some things to improve.	1
LGW-TIP-LGW on A320/A330. Both flights approx 1 hour delayed Servisair lounge at LGW basic and overcrowded quiet lounge in Tripoli. Uncrowded flights - very few pax in Business cabin. Comfortable seats for 3 hr journey but angled lie-flat seats on A330 too short for me (1.80m). Food tasty (no alcohol of course) limited but OK film choice on AVOD. FAs sweet but not all spoke english. Be aware Tripoli airport can be difficult to navigate as all signage in Arabic only!	1
Aeromexico is a good airline but there is a huge gap in quality from aircraft to aircraft for instance last week I flew from CUN to MEX in a new B737-800 excellent in every way. My next leg was MEX to TIJ in a B737-700 old cramped no inflight entertainment just one tiny bag of peanuts for a 3 hour flight toilet old and dirty. The boarding procedure AM is implementing is awful and useless. It takes longer and it is absurd. First they board pax on window seats then center seats and on final call aisle seats no matter if you are in row 10 or 24. Uncomfortable at the gates. AM is the best airline there is in Mexico.	1
Bangkok - Moscow - Bangkok. Flights arrived and left reasonably on time. Service was satisfactory and cabin staff seemed quite friendly. They spoke only Russian with me but I heard adequate English to the non speaking Russian behind me. Food and wine was OK and the entertainment adequate. The return overnight flight had a flat bed and I had sufficient rest to be able to rent a car on arrival in Bangkok the following morning. Aeroflot continue to provide a reasonably priced direct service to Moscow from Bangkok which is why I use them.	1
ATH-NTE 11 August 2012. Flight was on time the meal was served after one hour as we experienced turbulence and flight attendants weren't allowed to serve us. The meal was a sandwich and endless drinks. Crew friendly and smiling. NTE-ATH 18 August 2012: Flight on time. Boarded fast it was 100% complete like the last flight. Flight attendants served the meal immediately so people could sleep (the flight was late in the night). The meal was a sandwich again. Arrived on time. Nice experience will travel again this summer.	1
Last August from Athens to Prague and back. The airplane was an Airbus A320. Clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Flight took off on time and arrived in Prague on time. The meal was poor but the trip was short. The first part of my trip the aircraft was full from Prague to Athens after 5 days only 60% full. I paid only 125 euros for the ticket!	1
Athens-Milan MXP. Airbus A320. Flight on time. Very pleasant trip. Cabin staff as always friendly and helpful. Nice meal.	1
Buenos Aires to Trelew and back. Overall very good service for the value. Smiling and helpful cabin attendants and good snack box provided on such a short flight. No inflight entertainment only magazines (this point should be improved). Fast and efficient baggage delivery. I would certainly recommend this airline.	1
We flew to Johannesburg from London Gatwick via Tripoli to attend the World Cup. All flights near enough on time and a smooth transit through Tripoli. Tripoli airport is not too bad although I wouldn't like to spend more than a few hours there. The entertainment was good food as good as expected the were polite (but spoke little English) and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg room. I did get the impression that the staff were probably a little too laid back at times. Overall the value for money was excellent the customer service was good and the planes were modern (although they did need cleaning up a bit.)	1
London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!	1
I had two flights with them in business class MEX-MAD and LHR-MEX. The Madrid flight was in a 777 and the London - Mexico flight was in a new 787. Completely different experience. They have substantially improved their food offering but now the crews have an excellent attitude in the way they treat the clients. The seat in the 777 is outdated as is the entertainment system but the 787 flat bed seat is a great quality seat. I can never sleep on planes and when I went up to the galley for a snack I found the cabin crew to be very friendly.	1
Due to past experiences I was weary to pick AM on this YUL-MEX-YUL flight nevertheless this time they surprised me and exceeded my expectations on both sectors. Both flights were on the newer 737-800s. I was upgraded on the outbound flight. Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.	1
Flew from AGP-DUB on EI585 (A333) paid a bit extra to sit in Business class not sure how comfortable I'd be lying 'down' at that angle for a long period of time or if it's worth it. The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work. Recommend all the same just don't be in a rush after landing.	1
I flew business class to Ireland for my vacation and I can say it was the best flight. It was all I thought it would be on Aer Lingus. The business class seating and all you get is worth the value in all areas. The service from the crew was great always seeing if you needed something if you were doing ok and keeping you updated.	1
Travelled LGW-YYZ business class. My first trip with Aer Lingus long haul and I was not sure what to expect. The experience was just perfect. Business cabin has only 12 seats plenty of room for storage. I had no neighbour making feel well isolated for a quiet flight. Sleeping was comfortable although the not fully flat bed is a bit tricky to handle at first. Food was one of the best I had on the many airlines I've flown with. Finally staff were very careful smiling and professional. I would definitively fly again with them. The only point to improve would be a better dedicated business check-in at LGW.	1
I flew from Vienna to Hong Kong via Moscow and back. A few suggestions for improvement: the airline could work on the friendliness and on the language skills of its stuff. The inflight entertainment for the long distance flight was perfect but very poor for the short ones. Food and drinks was very good!	1
HKG-SVO-MAD and return from BCN. Flight crews on all 4 sectors were very professional and made every effort to make the flights as smooth as possible. Food very impressive both in terms of quality and quantity. Seats and Inflight Entertainment were not among the best but still met the average standards you would expect for long-haul flights. The real drawback for Aeroflot is the transfer at SVO in addition to all those comments already made we encountered extra problems as we only had about an hour transfer time on our return journey. A staff member called all passengers to HKG at passport control we were guided through Terminal D and E to the boarding gate at F - all by running there were no trolleys so we had to take all carry on luggage by hand - that's 20 minutes running. Our checked in baggage was left behind only arrived the next day according to Aeroflot's ground agent at HKG this is a daily recurring problem to this flight.	1
Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice. Value for money was excellent.	1
Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather. A nice stewardess kept me informed of this. Staff were very professional with the delay too. Overall a great experience.	1
London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!	1
CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.	1
"London Gatwick-Tripoli-Johannesburg return. I booked on price so my expectations were fairly low. The first three sectors were more or less on time fourth just under 30 minutes late. I was pleasantly surprised to find LGW check-in desk open nearly 4 hours before the scheduled departure time! Airline food is rarely very good in economy but Afriqiyah's compared quite favourably with most. My only criticism is that a couple of dishes were quite spicy - and a choice was not always offered. I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite ""no smoking"" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn't have to spend long there. The staff there were pleasant and helpful though. I would consider flying with Afriqiyah again if the price is right especially once the expansion and upgrading of Tripoli Airport is complete."	1
Was extremely pleased with the level of friendly professional service we received on two flight segments from Cincinnati OH to Cancun Mexico a few weeks ago. The stewardesses on every one of the four flights were so helpful and willing to please that I was taken back due to the fact that of late stewardesses in general have carried an air of arrogant indifference. The planes were very clean. The schedule was adhered to.	1
During the 3hrs and 20min flight from Mexico City to Tijuana Aeromexico created a very pleasant experience reminiscent of the golden age of flight. The crew was young and attentive professional and bilingual. The aircraft was a wonderfully well kept 737-800 with a state of the art entertainment system. Complementary snacks and drinks including alcohol were served twice during the journey. Landing was on time and arrival at the gate was relatively quick. I would definitely fly with them again.	1
Boston to Shannon March 9 (E10134). Shannon to Boston on March 18 2014 (E10135). I have been flying with Aer Lingus since I was a child and am never disappointed with the food service and hospitality offered. The planes are well kept and clean. The crew were so attentive - they define Irish hospitality.	1
Travelled on the Aer Lingus Regional ATR DUB-BRS-DUB return on Sat morning 7th May. Excellent service overall. Flights departed on time arrived early. The return was on one of the new aircraft. The Aer Lingus lounge in T2 is excellent and well worth the short detour. Only point to note is that all the Regional flights take off from the one gate in Dublin T2. You proceed downstairs onto the same level as US pre clearance through gate 412. I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'. The screen at the gate advised next flight was the BRS flight and the Glasgow was boarding first. So perhaps they need to look at that or advise that there is a short bus ride over to the aircraft. Otherwise well recommended Vs the competition and the fare was excellent value for a short flight.	1
AMS-SVO-KJA-SVO-AMS. Economy Feb 15/23 2014 the only one-stop option on this route. AMS-SVO on Feb 15 was OK A321 clean and relatively new. The biggest problem here was the handling agent in Schiphol apparently Aeroflot took the cheapest option out of available and all the issues such as slow poorly trained staff and poor co- ordination with airport services - everything is delayed all the time and every time (I took over 10 Aeroflot flights from AMS during the last two years). No entertainment system. SVO-KJA on the same day was served by a brand new B777. A decent entertainment system but not much space in the economy cabin. KJA-SVO-AMS was served by A319 and 320 - everything described for the A321 on the AMS-SVO route applies here as well. Business-class check- in in KJA was a very strange procedure but in does not have to do with Aeroflot I guess (although my experience with their KJA agents was thoroughly unpleasant so probably they just do not care to check how those procedure work). Safety training of the crew seems to be a very big issue. They just could not care less. Their usual passengers are not very disciplined in general but the crew just does not act on this at all. Food was good on all the legs although the beverages were a bit below average though - juice and wines were really bad (alcohol only on international legs). Transfer in SVO from Terminal F international to terminal D domestic (and especially back) is still a big problem. Poor information little help from staff. When you are transferring from D to F you really shall look around carefully at each turn (there lots of them) - once you skip a little half-hidden pointer - you are running into a wrong spot and getting through security control (double!) all over again. No SkyPriority service in the Terminal F except business class check-in counters and a VERY poor tiny and shabby business lounge.	1
SU-273 Bangkok to Moscow 22nd January then we transferred to a flight to Stockholm. I must say I was surprised over the quality. We bought two ticket going from BKK to Arlanda round-trip Aeroflot was about 750$ cheaper than the rest. At the airport we got upgraded to premium economy for free. Good food good service and some of the air stewardesses even smiled. Others were not so happy but they where attentive. Of course my upgrade affects my review the only complaint I might have is that the check in was to slow but what do you expect when the plane is full and many get upgraded.	1
LCA-ATH-MUC. Flight on-time and very pleasant . Cabin crew polite and helpful. Hot breakfast served before we reach Athens and normal meal at the Munich flight. The price a little bit expensive but I would recommend it! As always satisfactory.	1
I flew SKG-STR-SKG. I enjoyed the flight. The seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. In addition flight departed on-time. The crew always had a smile however the in-flight entertainment was poor.	1
SYD-EZE-GIG-IGR-EZE-SYD Plus AEP-FTE-AEP. What a great airline for the price. We flew Club Condor class ex SYD. Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great. If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help. Will definitely fly AR again.	1
I flew to Johannesburg via Brussels and Tripoli return. Flight attendants great who provided a cheerful and competent service. One even went to the business class to get me a lovely cup of coffee when he realised coffee was crucial to my travelling pleasure! Yes there were delays in Tripoli - but immigration officials were welcoming and we were kept fully informed as to the reasons for hold up. Toilets in Tripoli are as bad as everyone else suggests - do avoid. Useful to know that they accept Euros in their Duty Free and cafe.	1
I have used Afriqiyah Airways for four return trips Gatwick - Accra over the last 14 months. Treatment has been unfailingly good. Yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport. The cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good.	1
London-Tripoli-Johannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.	1
Tripoli - London Gatwick - Tripoli. New plan good entertainment attentive service. No problems apart from painfully slow Check-In at Gatwick and no alcohol.	1
Flew LAX to MEX (AM649) on a 737-800. Paid $30 extra for AM Plus seats on row #7. Boarding at LAX was a bit of a mess because AeroMexico boards every window seat first then every middle seat aisle seat etc. Airplane was clean and my AM Plus seat had a few more inches of extra leg room. Take-off was smooth and the flight was good. A few hours into the flight breakfast and coffee were served. I did not partake because I was asleep (a special thank you to the flight attendant for not waking me up). Flight attendants were courteous respectful and polite. We arrived in MEX about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Several days later I flew MEX to LAX (AM648) on a brand new 737-800. Once again sat on AM Plus row #7. Beautiful brand new leather seats with a personal TV screens. Every AM Plus seat was tastefully decorated with pillows blankets and headphones. A croissant sandwich peanuts chocolate pudding and drinks were served. Flight was smooth and arrived on time at LAX. Very nice flight attendants. Will fly again.	1
Dublin to Cardiff return. I have used the Friday evening and return on Sunday night frequently over the last two years. They have recently had more new planes (ATR 72) prior to this the flights were invariably a few hours late. However they are now mostly less than one hour late. Service from the crew is good for a one hour flight. Parking at a remote stand in Dublin then having a bus transfer plus a lengthy walk to Arrivals. Would be good if Ryanair returned to this route.	1
SVO-JFK return in business. Generally nice experience. Smooth priority boarding at SVO excellent champagne and starters though the main course looked a bit cheap. Attentive staff. I noticed that the flight attendants on both flights tended to smile more and respond more quickly to those who smiled in return. The seats are not lie-flat unfortunately but still softer and more comfortable than the recliners installed by LH on their A380s. The screen is large enough with good colors but the content lacks recent action movies.	1
ATH-PRAGUE-ATH. A320. Efficient and polite cabin crew smooth service although economy cabin was full. The cold snack (sandwich and tiny chocolate) was rather of poor quality/taste. Cold and hot drinks were offered with a smile. My score would be a 10 if the cold meal was a bit more inspiring!	1
Aegean is usually my choice when the price is reasonable very trustworthy. Aircraft are clean and meals tasteful. Almost always on time. Friendly staff friendly excess baggage policy.	1
MXP-ATH Jul 15th. A321 aircraft new and comfortable and large legroom. We had a hot meal something that I've seen just on LR flights. Flight on time and efficient crew. ATH-HER Jul 17th. A320 aircraft. Very short domestic flight but more stressful than the previous one. The plane was very crowded and the boarding chaotic. As the flight was just 30 mins long we were served in a rush remarkable that the crew managed to serve 150 people is a short time. In general I'd fly them again.	1
Australia to Brazil. I had no problems at all during the flight. No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters. There's no entertainment at all. You pay what you get for the price I paid I am satisfied.	1
Been flying AM 429 Monday morning flight for about 3 months now and returning on Thursdays flight 422. Very friendly and professional service airplanes are modern and with more leg room than most.	1
I myself am a frequent flyer. I live in Paris but my family lives in Cork. Aer Lingus is the only airline to offer a direct link to Cork from Paris. The staff always have a smile when you travel. Food is nice their is no In flight entertainment screens but its OK for a 1 hr 40min flight.	1
I have travelled with various airlines out of Dublin in the past haven taken a break from Aer Lingus. However recently I flew with them to Munich and have to say I was very impressed overall with the service. I checked in on my mobile presented my boarding card on my mobile and had no problems using it getting through security. The aircraft was an A320 I was seated at row 12a which was an emergency exit so I had plenty of leg room on way out. Food was of good quality although I would have liked even a complimentary tea or coffee instead of 2.50 but only a small negative. On my return home the journey was a little more eventful which ended with me collapsing in the middle of the cabin. I can not commend the cabin crew enough for looking after me and administering the necessary first aid etc to ensure I was safe and comfortable. The crew were professional calm and reassuring which now looking back on it is what some other airlines are missing. I will definitely be a convert back to Aer Lingus.	1
Staff at airport and staff on plane all very professional great seats comfortable plenty of leg room and food lovely. I travelled with my 3 grandchildren from Dublin - Madrid return and found it a very enjoyable experience. Staff were lovely had great patience with customers. Only downside was Dublin airport had no facilities for children only the play area at Burger King which my children were too big for.	1
Moscow-Shanghai with brand new A330-300 at the end of December. Not very punctual - departed and arrived 20 minutes late. Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom. When you recline your seat the bottom part goes forward it makes the legroom smaller. Not the best experience ever but I would fly them again if the price is fair.	1
Flew SVO-ICN (codeshare with Korean). Not much to rave or complain about - flight departed and landed on time decent seats good IFE. If only they turn on the IFE before departure and leave it on after final descent (during departure/landing the IFE reset to front camera - not much to see during night). Meals edible vegetarian meal option honoured. Will fly them again if price is good.	1
9th December from Krasnodar to Moscow Sheremetyevo on Flight SU 1103 and missed the connection to Flight SU 263 to London Heathrow. I flew yesterday on Aeroflot and experienced delays and missed connection through no fault of Aeroflot. I was dealt with by their many ground staff at Sheremetyevo extremely well the plane was modern and well flown and I would strongly recommend them for the service I received. Full marks and strongly recommended.	1
Porto to Paris Orly on ZI 312 (A320) on 28 March 2014. First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid . Not sure if I'll have another chance to travel on them again but if they have routes that I want to fly I'll keep them in mind.	1
BSL-ALG-BSL on A320 both legs. First time flown ZI and overall was an impressive experience. The cabin was quite clean and the seat was quite comfortable with good pitch. Warm and delicious meal for 2 hrs flight was a very good service. Another positive was the 30 kg free baggage for all economy class passenger.	1
Our family of 4 had two flights: Sep 15 from Rome to Athens Sep 18 from Athens to Prague. Both flights were satisfactory. Each one left on time. Candies were offered before take off. Snacks consisted of sandwich and yoghurt; this was for the morning flight to Prague. The evening flight from Rome also offered a sandwich and juice. Good coffee was available. The economy seats were comfortable for my Asian size. But the seat seems to be of standard size whether on an Asian American or European airline. The A320 cabins were clean. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. Check in at Fiumicino and Venizelos airports were fast and straight forward. The only inconvenience we experienced was at Athens airport. It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal. That wasn't the case with the morning flight to Prague as the plane was connected to a tube. Overall value for money is satisfactory. We'd choose Aegean again if an opportunity arises in the future.	1
Athens-Mykonos-Athens. All flights on time very nice looking Airbus 320; good leather seats overhead TV screens and nice cabin crew. They even tried to do some service on those 25 mins flights (sweets and drinks) but on both legs they managed to reach first 6 or 7 rows which is ridiculous in general - nobody expects any service on such a short hop so why bother?	1
Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.	1
My husband and I flew to Mexico City and then to Manzanillo. Staff were friendly and helpful. We encountered no problems with this airline. Our flights ran on schedule and our luggage was not lost. On the return trip I was missing a form at the time of boarding staff quickly helped me fill it out and held the plane for me to run back to the boarding gate. We will use this airline again. We feel like we received good service for the price of our ticket.	1
My children used the unaccompanied minors service from ORD-MEX-VER. I was very nervous as were they. They had never flown before plus being alone they were scared. None the less they had a great flights. Their layover in Mexico City was fun they said. They were taken to a game room that was a restricted area for unaccompanied minors only where they were supervised and played video games and watched movies. My children said everyone they encountered with AeroMexico were helpful and friendly. No problems at all with delays baggage etc... I will use this airline again. My children will be flying annually to Mexico to visit their father.	1
Paris to Mexico City. The staff at the airport in both airports (Mexico / Paris) were friendly and helpful. The plane is a new B787 Dreamliner with pretty modern installation. The food was served very good and the entertainment was for a long 12h flight very amused. I will prefer Aeromexico for future flights from Europe to Mexico or to Central / South America.	1
Volgograd-Moscow Sheremetyevo-Sochi Adler in business class Sochi Adler-Moscow Sheremetyevo in economy class. Excellent experience first time with Aeroflot. All flights on time and baggage checked and delivered promptly with priority tags on business was the first to be delivered. Crew friendly and very professional seat comfort excellent leather seating in Business class with plenty of high-quality food and wines. On business service rivals some airline first classes even on Russian domestic short sectors printed menus and wine list lots of reading material (counted 5 different Aeroflot publications on a 1:45 min flight) and crews very attentive and caring. All of them spoke good English. IL-96 aircraft very roomy and spacious should be a nice experience on longer flights. Would fly Aeroflot again without hesitation.	1
Have flown Aegean several times to Chania via Athens. Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.	1
Return trip to ATH using Aegean for the first time. Would book again. Check in at LHR ok but more efficient in ATH (which is a great airport by the way). Helped that the main carrier in ATH so they have the resource to get people checked in. In flight service good - nice crew on both legs with lots of smiling and team spirit. Food ok but then we all have low expectations. Overall very good experience and would definitely chose over BA on this route.	1
MEX-PVR-MEX-CUN on EMB190 B737-700 and B737-800. EMB190 and B737-800 were new and great B737-700 was old but well kept. First row on economy is great with plenty of leg room. All flights were on time and service was good. They offer only refreshments and alcoholic drinks. Attendants were nice and speak English perfectly. Terminal 2 at MEX is modern and great. Luggage drop and security was very fast. On B737-700 and -800 there was full IFE service with more than 10 movies.	1
LIM-MEX-LIM Business Class (Clase Premiere) in April was a perfect example on how Aeromexico has come to represent an inconsistent product. Plane is an oldish 737 without personal IFE but it was just fine in both legs. Seat Ok and amenity kit that Aeromexico now handles only on overnight flight with some space for improvement even though it was delivered with a really nice IPAD case. As far as service is concerned a huge difference between the MEX-LIM and the LIM-MEX leg. On the first leg it was outstanding with a professional warm and polite flight attendant. Good food and good selection of drinks. On the way back flights attendants did not even bother to greet passengers and performed their job mechanically and without interest. What a difference! What a lack of consistency in the product delivered by Aeromexico. A 3/10 would be a perfect grade to describe this last experience.	1
SEN-DUB-SEN: Again very impressed with Aer Lingus Regional their new ATR aircraft are even better than before. Crew very attentive and flight on time both ways. Would definitely use them again instead of Ryanair from Stansted. Only gripe was hand luggage allowance. We were really restricted on what we could take onboard and had to end up purchasing another checked in bag so it was annoying when you see passengers with bags that well exceed the dimensions on their website carrying them on board.	1
"Dublin-Malaga 7th April EI 584/585. Booked flex fare as it includes lounge access bags etc on this particular flight. Aer Lingus use the the Airbus 330 so you can reserve the seats normally used in Premier Class (economy service). All good nice crew as per previous comments the IFE is a bit of a joke even in the premier seats the remote control doesn't sync with the screen and the touch screen has to be ""thumped"" to get any reaction. Choice of movies and TV was poor but I didn't take the flight to view movies used my iPad. Onboard wifi available at 11.95 euros per hour return flight same good crew but I felt a little stretched as they now operate with minimum crew numbers of 8 on board as against 11 when I last flew this route. One comment I do have to make ..there has been huge media coverage on Aer Lingus launching their new ""Bia"" inflight menu by celebrity chef Clodagh McKenna someone should point out not everyone in Ireland is as addicted to cheese Ms McKenna appears to be! Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese. I'm a great believer in not trying to fix something that wasn't broken. Your old pre-order menu and onboard menu was edible! Take a tip from other airlines purchase on board menus. All in all Aer Lingus are good."	1
ARN-SVO-BKK return on A320/A333/B773/A319. Nice new planes and all on schedule. Food varied between fair and bad. No alcohol available due to past troublesome experiences with drunk passengers. Few smiles from staff but service good. IFE very good on B773. If food a bit better and wine available I would have rated a 4 star experience.	1
ODS-SVO-IAD Economy. Great value if you want a good price good food and don't mind not having the latest IFE or can read Russian newspapers. Security can be slow transferring at Sheremetyevo but then again international transfers at USA airports are slow too. Plane for about a 2 hour time to make transfers when in terminal D. Staff on the legs I was on were friendly and helpful. It helps a lot to speak Russian or at least some Russian words.	1
Belfast-Rhodes-Belfast. Clean Airbus A320. Both flights on time friendly staff but the 'meal' they served consisted of a dry bread roll with one small thin slice of ham which was dry. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meal unless it was water.	1
As always excellent service professional attitude for both the ground staff in Brussels as well as the people on board on the BRU-CFU flight on 17 August 2012. I am a frequent flyer with more than 30-35 flights per year. Aegean is the top of my preferences for both my professional trips as well as my vacation. This time I flew with my dog and staff on the ground have been extremely helpful in making my trip troubles free. The service on board is much better from the competition in the Belgium-Greece route. There is a good meal as well as free drinks throughout the flight. The airbus was clean and nicely decorated with enough leg space. In a few words: Aegean was an excellent choice.	1
I'm a frequent business class customer although on domestic flights this 'business class' turns into 'club economy'. It is hard to understand that the most expensive seats carry the name 'economy' attached to them. The catering service is very poor excluding alcoholic drinks and real food which is replaced by sandwiches served in a a very 'low cost' style box.	1
Sydney to Buenos Aires. Was travelling on the great unknown with this airline so I kept my expectation's low. Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies. For $1200 round-trip plus 2 internal flights I really can't complain.	1
After a six month assignment in Argentina flying almost only Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Almost 30 domestic flights and no cancellations only one significant delay (3 hours) due to airport strike. Service good to excellent free snack (5-8 dollar value to US domestic standards) beverages offered once or twice (even on flights under an hour) Flight attendants friendly and efficient. I am impressed it is now better than any domestic option in the US.	1
LIM-MEX-ORD economy round-trip. My only complaints are: 1) They forgot my vegetarian meal on LIM-MEX leg. The flight attendant brushed me off and just left without even asking if I wanted a drink or a regular meal. Never bothered to check and never came back. 2) They sold me a flight that had a 1.5 hours layover in Mexico City I wasn't aware of the whole customs-immigration-checking my bags again at MEX airport. If they know of this whole ordeal why would they sell flights with such short layovers? Food and service: Most staff were pleasant. The food was pretty decent and free drinks even alcoholic ones. The flight didn't have individual screens so there's only one movie option. They did have radio and gave headphones a pillow and a blanket. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. As a side note if you have a connection through Mexico airport and are pressed for time make sure you ask the personnel if you can't find something as its lacking some signs. The conveyor belt for my flight was in a separate room than most of the belts had I not asked someone I probably would've waited in vain.	1
"Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this ""invitation"". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions. If they don't address these issues they may find more and more people opt for their competitors like Ryanair."	1
Our flight from Belfast to Malaga was cancelled on the 8/4/2014 reasons unknown and we were moved to the 9th. This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time. I really can't fault this airline every single employee I had connect with either from the call center to the gate agents to the cabin crew made us feel welcomed. It is a shame that the return flight from Malaga to Belfast left to early for us otherwise I would have made this a return trip.	1
Moscow-Hong Kong flight was well below my expectations. Terminal F has been revamped with too many shops and not enough seats. Passengers camped on the stairs and the floor. As there were other flights to China departing from nearby gates almost at the same time one can only imagine the pushing shouting and queue-jumping. Allocating more space to people and less to shops would help address the problem. We boarded on time but some passengers had so many duty-free shopping bags that overhead storage soon reached maximum capacity. Tempers flared departure was delayed. I had to keep my backpack under the seat thus reducing that precious little space. After takeoff we were told that the entertainment system was out of order. No films no music no games. nothing. I had ordered a vegetarian meal at the time of buying the ticket online 6 months earlier and this is usually a very tasty Asian- style hot meal. This time my name didn't appear on the flight attendants' list despite being clearly indicated in the electronic ticket in my possession. Flight attendants ignored the issue and just apologized for the mistake. The best they could offer was a normal tray with two small salads instead of one. A few hours later when they served breakfast I realised that 2 out of 3 standard options were ok for vegetarians. Why wasn't a breakfast tray offered to me at dinner time? Flight attendants started serving tea and coffee. Due to turbulence they had to stop serving hot drinks and at least 100 passengers were left without any hot beverages to accompany their breakfast. The turbulence ended but serving hot beverages was never resumed. All in all not the best experience.	1
First time on Aegean for a family of 4 to go from Istanbul to Athens. Lines at airport moved fast no hassle on luggage flight left on time and arrived early seats were fairly comfortable and to our surprise we were offered a generous snack even though the flight was barely an hour duration. Overall superior in quality and service than any of the domestic flights we have taken in the US.	1
Sydney to Buenos Aires return. The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.	1
We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.	1
I booked my trip to Santiago de Chile from San Francisco with AM just because they were skyteam partners. The inflight service was great. I was allowed to priority board with my delta silver status. I even got access to skyteam lounge in Santiago without asking. Food was a bit of a let down especially since I requested a vegetarian meal. Other than that the entertainment was good not hundreds of choices but I found the selection of movies and programs fresh and entertaining. All four legs of the flight were on time and staff were very helpful. Even though I didn't know any Spanish I was able to communicate which is often a problem. Overall be it luck or their usual code of conduct I had a great experience with AM and would recommend to any one. Economical and comfortable despite a 16 hour trip.	1
GDL to LAX. It was a very pleasant flight for many reasons. Staff were very friendly and willing to help with any question. The food served was good for a 3 hour flight. They served yoghurt with cookies and fruit. There was inflight entertainment but no option all that there was available is what they played. Overall I really liked this airline and am willing to fly with them in the future.	1
Our flight going over from JFK to Moscow was good as well as the food. However on the way back home from St. Petersburg is where all the problems started. Our original flight was delayed 12 hours which meant missing all our connections. We stood in line for 5 hours. The service at the airport was horrible. No one would help us get a flight. After many hours different lines talking to many representatives we made a call to our Travel Agent and the Emergency help number that we had. Only after these calls were we able to get another reservation home. The flight was fine but the on ground service is far from good or caring.	1
Sep 13 2013 back from Russia to the USA. Flight 1481 Moscow-New York. I have been travelling Aeroflot for many years but I have never had such an uncomfortable seat in my life. Seems like the seats were designed by Gestapo for torturing passengers for 10 hours. Short narrow leaned forward! I will never understand the purpose of the head piece which makes your head protrude forward even more unless you are more than 2 meters tall. I felt very uncomfortable and tired. It was especially bothersome due to slow food service (it took the flight attendants about 2 hours to serve lunch and tidy up).	1
SVO-HKG in the new 777-300 ER. Comfort is fantastic - I would say much better than even Cathay new business class let alone European airlines. Staff attention great. Food could be more imaginative and refined but generally very good quality. Lounge at SVO old terminal F is incredibly old and not good. I would recommend taking a short walk over to the lounge in the new terminal E instead. Aeroflot making a strong effort in long-haul business class to get closer to the leading airlines and is on the right track!	1
SKG to HER. Flight was on time! The plane an A320 Airbus was new and clean inside/out. Cabin crew was pleasant and caring the on board service was good even though the flight was just 1 hour. Seats were comfortable and you have the option to check in online! I have flown many times domestic and abroad and am always satisfied.	1
London Heathrow to Larnaca. Among the most attentive and pleasant crew I have come across. Clean and new airbus food service was very good. Drink service frequent - around 5 times for a 4.5 hr flight. Overall very welcoming and pleasant.	1
Lille to Algiers. The flight has been delayed (2hrs), but the Air Algerie's airport workers gave us some sandwiches and soft drinks to apologize for the delay, a good point. The cabin crew were very professional. The aircraft (B767) was clean and in a good shape. The meal was excellent. Tea, coffee, and soft drinks have been served inflight. We landed smoothly at Algiers. The ticket price was good, and includes in it 30kg of luggage. A very good experience with Air Algerie.	1
ALG-CDG-ALG Dep 14/01/14 Ret 21/01/14. Very nice trip with my wife and my son (2 years old). No delay B737-800 sky interior not very clean and the cabin crew are not professional. Very good meals and wine. The price was cheap (450 euros for 2 adults and 1 child).	1
I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.	1
I had an excellent flight from MEX to JFK on New Year's Day on one of their new 787s. Check-in staff was helpful and well-organized. We boarded and left on time. Cabin staff was professional and friendly; the breakfast frittata was great and there was a variety of movies to choose from during the flight. They even offered wine in Economy Class. The 787 is a great plane and flying in this plane was a great experience. We arrived at JFK 30 minutes early.	1
I had a positive experience with Aeromexico from JFK to MEX via Cancun on Christmas. JFK check-in was efficient with no extra fees for checking a bag. They also served complimentary breakfast which was a decent omelette. Cabin staff was friendly and professional. We left and arrived on time. I had a 3-hour layover before taking a flight to Toluca (at a bargain fare) and asked Cancun check-in staff if I could change that leg of the trip to MEX. I was switched to an earlier CUN-MEX flight at no extra charge. The aircraft from CUN to MEX was brand new and spotlessly clean. We left and arrived on time.	1
Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.	1
Flew JFK to LHR with family of 5 and overall was very satisfied. Transatlantic flights were not full and the whole family had extra room. Only irritating issues were too many announcements which kept everybody awake and seat armrests which do not come up all the way allowing one to stretch out over empty seats. Dublin to London flights were also good. Although we would have preferred direct flights the savings going through Dublin were substantial and well worth the slight inconvenience plus on the way home one goes through Immigration in Ireland which works very well.	1
In the last year I have flown TLV-SVO and return about 5 times. Good service very friendly staff new aircraft's - every time I have had very good experience.	1
LCA-LHR on a nice clean A321. Aircraft left Larnaca on time cabin crew looked smart and were polite I had paid only £80 for my one way flight value for money was excellent as all drinks and food was included. Although cabin crew only came round I think 3 times on the 5 hour flight drinks were available on request if needed and cabin crew were happy to serve from the galley. In flight meal was average I find catering on all flights from Larnaca not that great! Seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room pilot kept us updated on arrival times and the weather back in the UK which is always nice to know you're going to land bang on time. Despite the bad weather in London landing was probably the smoothest I've ever had on a flight didn't know I had touched the ground! Just wish A3 didn't fly into Terminal 1 at LHR as its not that great and is rather run down other than that Aegean cannot be faulted. A great little airline and I will definitely fly with them again to Greece or Cyprus!	1
Flew Aegean to Santorini late June. Short and sweet flight. Cabin crew were professional and aircraft very clean. There was no food and inflight entertainment because of short flight nice gesture providing passengers with a light refreshment.	1
Paris to Algiers then to Ouagadougou and back. Overall I found this airline good value for money: they are cheap and offer minimal service. The aircraft's were old but kept in a good state except for the washrooms which were disgusting. Seats were rather comfortable. On the Algiers-Ouagadougou leg 1st class seating was attributed randomly to economy passengers. The meals were excellent even on the shorter Paris-Algiers flights. The food is halal but wine is available. Of my 4 flights only one was late by about one hour. No information whatsoever was given while we were waiting but the crew apologised once we were let in.	1
"Nov 1 Algiers-Ghardaia by ATR 72. 1 hrs late departure due to late arrival of the aircraft. Confusing as destination ""Oran"" was shown at the departure gate. Flight full. Some biscuits water and a soft drink was provided. Announcements in French and Arabic only. It is a domestic flight but on arrival and departure immigration has to been cleared. Return Nov 3 Flight on-time long wait for the luggage in Algiers because of a parking problem. Airline recommended as flying is better than 10 hrs by bus."	1
SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.	1
Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.	1
Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).	1
I had a great experience with Aeromexico on a round trip from Las Vegas to Guadalajara. The aircraft was very clean. The loading process was efficient and quick. The flight attendants were very professional and all were bi- lingual. The entire staff of Aeromexico were pleasant and concerned with customer satisfaction.	1
BHD-LGW A319 January. Perfectly acceptable short flight with friendly crew. Boarding is slow because all managed by just 1 person.	1
Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements. Nice experience and nice product and great crew.	1
CWL-DUB and DUB-CWL flight EI3291 29/10/13. Outbound - The flight attendants always had a smile and were very helpful throughout. The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline. Even though our flight departed late we landed just 5 minutes later than scheduled. I have recommended this airline to family and friends and actually me and a friend have booked to go back to Ireland with Aer Lingus on the new BRS-SNN route in April! Looking forward to it!	1
We flew JFK to Moscow and the returned St Petersburg through Moscow to JFK an 8 to 9 hour flight. All aspects were better than most carriers I have flown. Check in was professional the flight attendants were attentive the two meals served and the food tasted good to very good. The plane an Airbus 300 as I recall was clean and in good condition. The entertainment system gave free movies (free ear buds handed out) music and TV. The luggage arrived with us. The connection in Moscow was easy. I have only good things to say about my experience with Aeroflot. I would absolutely fly them again and the cost was about 1/2 what it would have been on Air France.	1
Krasnodar - Moscow - Omsk. Check-in in Krasnodar was chaotic and no drop bags and run counter. (It was peak summer season). The actual flights were OK. I received my preferred seats on both flights and quite good English spoken by cabin staff. Reasonable meals were served on both flights evening though the Omsk sector started at 1.40 am. Both sectors were fairly well on time although departing Krasnodar was a little late (because of the problems with checking in. No entertainment on either flight - both around 3 hours).	1
CDG-MOW-OVB. Upgraded to business class. Compared with Air France Aeroflot offers a great service in business class with a small gift and more choice of meals. Easy transfer at MOW. Flew an A320 with a good seat. No difficulties to sleep. Back in a IL96 nice 4 hr flight with a consistent breakfast (two choices). Crew sometimes rude but overall friendly. Lounge in MOW very quiet not many people attending. MOW-CDG on time again good service good (hot) meal and nice crew. Very good value for the money.	1
I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Aegean Air is highly recommended especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They are excellent in the following services: Great Lounges with separate room for smokers. Good luggage priority service in Greece. They must improve the following: Offer free 24h parking just like Olympic Air offer for their Gold members. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights. Dramatically improve their in flight food for local flights.	1
ATH - LHR sector on new Airbus A320. Very clean inside and out. Flight departed on time with pre-take off drinks in Business. Comfortable blue leather seats with the middle seat free allowing more room. Attractive and attentive crew service with a smile and very polite. Dinner was a choice from a menu which was plentiful and delicious with a good selection of Greek wines to accompany the meal. Headsets given out and a film shown during the flight. Regular water service throughout with pretzels and snacks. Excellent business product and would definitely use Aegean again.	1
CDG to ATH. Great experience. Hot dinner was served entertainment was available (which is not the case on the competing companies on that route). Flight on time. Staff was very friendly and professional.	1
Went from SKG to STR and after a week the other way around. My flights were A3510 and A3511. Excellent aircraft clean no malfunctioning seats inflight maps 2 captain announcements one the standard and one extra that we would experience some turbulence over Belgrade. Star-Alliance stylished meals served hot enough beverage and coffee happy to help flight attendants ultra-fast baggage drop-off and mobile check- in. I didn't even have to print my boarding pass. Highly recommended!	1
Frankfurt to Annaba this Summer return. The age of the plane from FFM to Alger was pretty old. The Alger- Annaba flight the same. On the return both planes were new. There was no delay. Service on the ground and onboard is ok. Food was excellent even during Ramadan. Take care at the Airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic Airport in Alger! Don't give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials.	1
SYD-EZE on July 21. While the aircraft was old and it lacks personal inflight entertainment it was well maintained. Good legroom. Crew were friendly and efficient. Left on time and arrived one hour early. All and all a good experience and extremely good value for money. I'm looking forward to my return in a few days.	1
Paris-Cork EI821 Dec 23 return Cork-CDG Dec 30. I travelled with Aer Lingus over Christmas/New Year. Very busy. Staff were very pleasant and unlike another airline on this route treating passengers with respect or weren't out-to-get me because I had a shopping bag with my carry-on coming on board. The staff make this airline very pleasant.	1
"Moscow to LHR. Flight delayed though just half an hour then bussed from Terminal D to the far side of F. Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained ""it's not our decision"". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I've had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority. Despite some positive aspects overall this was a disappointing experience."	1
London to Hong Kong via Moscow return. All flights you couldn't fault food of good standard flight attendants smart and professional great selection of entertainment only problem was other passengers getting up before plane had stopped at terminals. You know who you are and it makes life very difficult for the flight attendants.	1
On 16-JUN my flight from Milan to Athens (connecting to Mykonos) which was suppose to leave at 21.10 left at 02.00. We were given little info other than plane broken and a new one coming from Athens. When the new plane arrived the ground staff and gate were disorganized making the delay even longer. During this extreme delay we were given snacks and water. Once arriving into Athens and missing my flight to JMK a ticket agent helped us and put us on a departure getting us in only a few hours late on Olympic. I emailed Aegean three times to enquire about a refund or another ticket (As we were instructed to do both in MXP and ATH) and it took two emails to get a response. Overall Aegean usually pretty good (I fly once or twice a year) but this interaction made me lose some trust.	1
Flew from Athens to Santorini in a new A321 aircraft. Economy seats were leather and soft and comfortable and the luggage bins were very large (I was able to fit my acoustic guitar in the cabin). The views as the flight took off and landed were incredible but the flight tickets were slightly expensive for such a short distance. Inflight entertainment was unfortunately absent as the flight (1hr) was too short for it and beverages were only served to half the passengers for the same reason. Otherwise it was a good trip.	1
ALG-AAE. The flight to Annaba took 1hr and was uneventful. Air Algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good. But service is non-descript and like many airlines of North Africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything. So when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book. Their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights. Would fly them again but as I said it is nothing memorable.	1
TUN-ALG in the new 737-800NG (Business Class) a very good trip no delay good meat (champagne before take off). On time at Algiers clean cabin a very large seat and big space not like Air France or Alitalia in Business Class.	1
Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Bit apprehensive after reading reviews but both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and even a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.	1
CPH-SVO-DXB-NBO. Smooth check in all flights briefly on time and connections smooth. Lounge access given at all concerned airports as being Skyteam Gold (though AF). CPH-SVO on Airbus 321. Flight basically full. Service fine but sparse. Alcoholic drinks for sale only. A cold lunch tray given quality acceptable. Seat good was given a spacious emergency seat. Bus to terminals in SVO. SVO-DXB on Airbus 319. No IFE but who cares. 16 seats left in economy I volunteered to give up seat 7C to the back row next to toilets as it allowed for stretching. Service devoted. Alcohol charged as only free on intercontinental flights. I would assume that SVO-DXB is pretty much intercontinental? Service excellent though by sitting on last row one is left with no food options but the ones left (clalf-meat) was good. English poor-very poor. Staff charming young and in excellent mood. DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service - IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser. Luggage delivery at the belts in Nairobi stressful and confusing. Monitors were not properly working.	1
Flight SU2619 BRU-SVO on 19/06/2013 SU2 SVO-LED on 20/06/2013. Flight arrived on time in Brussels and in Moscow. Staff very friendly. Food on board was OK but could (should) have been warmer. Plane (Airbus A319) was clean. In-flight shopping is rather expensive. Connecting flight to St Petersburg was OK. Plane (Airbus A320) was clean food on board was OK (very good to be honest). Both flights were in time. Just a pity that it is not possible to check in at Brussels Airport for the connecting flight to St Petersburg. Check-in by Internet also not possible.	1
SGN-SVO-CPH. Economy class. Check-in in Saigon perfect painless and very accepting to wishes. Recognized Skyteam gold status and granted lounge access in Saigon as well as in SVO. Galaktika lounge in SVO had to inquire lounge card at transfer desk. Could choose any of 5(?) lounges. Flight SGN to SVO on Airbus 330-200. Approx. only 60% load was lucky to get some sleep as I needed it though day flight. News for international Aeroflot: they (again) serve wine (free) at economy-class though of limited quality! Good food 2 hot dishes offered at lunch at my seat (behind) only one choice left namely fish which however always is my first choice. Starter was mayonnaise marinated potatoes with red fish meat. Main dish was rice/catfish (white fish meat). Fantastic films on IFE! Small screens but easy to operate and good selection of films including some Russian movies of high quality. Staff nice and caring especially when speaking loud slow clear and polite English to them as their English is at times limited. Stewardesses were appealing dressed in neat smart orange-coloured summer uniforms! SVO-CPH in smaller Sukhoi jet which is nice similar to Airbus 319. Eventless trip soft drinks snack served (3 hours flight). Everything functioned OK. Arrived 20 minutes late due to long take-off cue of aircraft's waiting for permission.	1
The flight was good, the price of the ticket was low - about AED 900. For the money we paid the service was really good, there are some problems like there is no food provided so we had to buy this onboard the plane. We did not have personal TV and the inflight entertainment was poor but the cabin crew service was good. I recommend if you want a cheap ticket with good service, but no entertainment onboard.	1
TLV-HER and back. It was a charter flight so I expected a bad experience but was pleasantly surprised. We left on time. The A320 was new and clean. The cabin crew were very helpful and nice. Very informative announcements by the captain. Good leg space.	1
Paris to Corfu via Athens. All flights were on time aboard newish A320. Food served was ok not great. Absolutely nothing to complain about and the views of the coast were spectacular!	1
Athens to London in economy. The flight departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Very tasty meal served on board much bigger than expected. Several rounds of drinks movies shown during flight. Very attentive cabin staff. Overall an excellent flight for just EUR70.	1
MIA-EZE round trip and AEP-UAQ. Service on the long haul was great from reservation process through check- in and inflight. Airbus 340 from and back to Miami had spacious economy class seats and attentive flight attendants. Onboard entertainment on the long haul was rudimentary at best and food was the worst airline food ever. Embraer 190 used on subsidiary Austral between AEP and UAQ was clean: spacious and had in- seat state of the art entertainment and refreshments. Had mobility issues and Aerolineas staff went the extra mile to take care of me. Favourable contrast in ground service with US carrier on arrival back to MIA was notable.	1
Salta to Mendoza on E190 and was impressed. On time newish and clean plane snack box with drink for short flight and even some seatback IFE was available. FA's were professional at all times but perhaps a little devoid of smiles.	1
We have become regular business class passengers on Aer Lingus  they never fail to impress. This time we flew from Dublin to Orlando on EI 121 and returned from New York on EI 104. On both flights the service was quite outstanding. The crew are friendly but professional and the food and wine selections were of high end restaurant quality. Given our experience with other carriers business class usually at much higher fares the Aer Lingus product has to be one of the best available. We only wish they would once again provide a premium offering on European routes.	1
Recently I flew from St Petersburg - Moscow - NYC. It was an extremely pleasant flight. The seating (in economy) was A+ the meals were very well presented and the food was delicious. The FA's were well dressed polite and professional.	1
18 May: HAJ-SVO 25 May: SVO-ZRH. In the last month I was fortunate to travel with them twice. Both flights were consistently excellent. The food is amazing in terms of choice taste wine list and the service. I look forward to my next experience with Aeroflot business.	1
Sydney to Moscow and return in May 2013. Hong Kong to Moscow and return was in business class with Aeroflot. Very impressed. Seats on flight to Moscow were of an older type of business class seat but did everything I needed and all ancillary services (entertainment etc.) available. Seafood meal was probably the best airline meal I have ever had. (Expectations high but I think reasonable). On return flight had more recent capsule seats. Airbus planes looked new and counter service very good. Had domestic Aeroflot connection in Moscow to St Petersburg. Had to sprint from terminal F to D but made good time and domestic counter service again efficient and friendly. All planes on time.	1
A320 flight Sharjah-Yanbu (Saudi Arabia) on 16 Sept. Great flight. Check-in was easy and agent offered me a pass to the Biz Lounge for AED 100 with food wifi drinks. Lounge was nice but wifi didn't work - not a big deal. Flight boarded via bus so nice to walk up the plane. Flight attendants very friendly - speaking 8 languages so very diverse. Safety video is the best ever! All done with children so you really want to watch and pay attention. Ordered a turkey sandwich which was large and very tasty. Smooth flight and landed 10 min early. Really enjoyed the airline and flight.	1
30 January to 01 February. Jeddah - Sharjah - Jeddah. Reservation completed online with no difficulty. As a LCC Air Arabia offers free carry on luggage and additional checked baggage for SR 50. Also offered confirmed seat for SR 50. I took the seat confirmation on both legs. Did not take advantage of the advance purchase meal offer nor did I purchase anything to eat on the flights. Inflight entertainment on A320 was suitable for a short haul flight. Seats were comfortable and flight attendants professional and efficient. On board sky sales were relatively affordable but I did not notice any major brand names. Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time. I have flown Air Arabia Jeddah to Sharjah before and have enjoyed my flights I prefer the route rather than the Jeddah Dubai flight to avoid the hustle and bustle in Dubai airport. All in all a very enjoyable trip.	1
LHR-ATH. A good experience with Aegean the overnight flight was fairly busy but the crew were professional there were 2 drink runs and the meal was very good but the portions were small. A320 was clean and the leather seats were comfortable. Headsets were handed out there was a good music selection and a movie was shown on the overhead screens. Flight arrived into Athens a few minutes early and the luggage didn't take too long to appear. An extremely good service and would use them again without hesitation.	1
"Flying on the now retired Boeing 474-400 from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Even though it didn't have an entertainment device (just an old 15"" TV on the roof) the seats were really comfortable with good recline. Food wasn't bad and the service was extremely friendly and helpful. Flight delayed 30 mins but arrived on time. Return flight on the same aircraft."	1
Contrary to what a lot of people are putting here I had a very good experience with Aeromexico. I was departing from SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) to MEX (Mexico DF). Airline prices change too often and I bought my ticket well ahead of time to get it for a cheap price for a major carrier! Even while still in the airport as I am a nervous flyer the captain was nice enough to reassure me about the flight. On-board the flight attendants were very nice and friendly even giving me advise on what transportation to take to specific tourist places in Mexico city for a first-timer in the city. The food was okay and the movie was ok though I bought my own set of entertainment myself. All in all the flight and service was pretty good.	1
Use regularly on the ORD-DUB route as well as on its European short-haul routes. The transatlantic flights are always pleasant clean aircraft with friendly staff. IFE is adequate with personal seat-back TVs. Only complaints are that the economy seats are pretty hard and uncomfortable - they're actually nicer on the short-haul flights. I usually have to sit on the pillow to be comfortable. Also the departure gate area at ORD is too small for the number of passengers on the flight - numerous passengers end up standing and sitting on the floor in the hallway. Never had any serious issues with flight delays or baggage issues. Aer Lingus is head-and-shoulders above its only competition on the ORD-DUB route (AA) and its the clear choice for transatlantic flights to Ireland.	1
OVB-SVO-OVB (Novosibirsk) 1 week ago. Everything was OK on time. Plane was new A-320. Good meal and drink good attitude of FA's. At check-in I asked for an emergency exit seat - no problem.	1
Very good service they served two meals - dinner and breakfast and both times offered two choices (none of the USA airlines would feed you twice for free). They also offered free wine. All amenities were free of charge they offered newspapers free of charge (Russian newspapers though). The entertainment was poor. Cannot complaint about the 767 comfort.	1
Trivandrum to Sharjah and return. Being a frequent flyer on this route in my opinion Air Arabia is one of the best low cost carriers I have flown. Every time the flights were on time clean and tidy with not so bad seats and leg space. Food available for purchase on board was reasonable and quite good. Overall a very good value for money and a highly dependable airline for sticking on to the schedule every time.	1
Bangalore-Sharjah. Despite leaving at ungodly hours 3.30am in my case this is probably one of my favourite low cost carriers and in my opinion better than some full service airlines that fly from the middle east to India. Plane was clean and service was excellent plane half empty so had whole row to sleep. Since leaving so early in the morning lights are switched off early overall happy with the service Air Arabia provides.	1
LHR-ATH-LHR. Clean new Airbus 320 aircraft. Seats not perfect but good legroom compensates this. A selection of nice music before take off helps you fall in the good travelling mode. Both flights ahead of schedule. I'm scared of flying so a smiling and helpful flight attendants attitude definitely helped. Sweets before take off a small but nice touch. Decent proper meal with honest wine that actually tasted good. Overall a very good airline which helped me begin my holidays few hours before reaching Greece and prolonged it for a few hours when I was leaving.	1
Heathrow to Larnaca return. Aircraft A321 clean and tidy. Departed and arrived on time both ways. Good food inflight entertainment free drinks great service and friendly crew. Booked well in advance and got a great price. All in all a very good airline.	1
Flight late departing Nashville to Cancun but made good time and arrived near original time. Plane clean cabin personnel courteous almost robot-like neatly dressed. Apparently the flight time from Nashville to Cancun is not a 'meal or snack' flight. We were offered complimentary sodas juice beer mixed drinks and a small cup of mixed nuts - one time - for our 2 hour 40 minute flight at 11am. We never saw the cabin attendants again until we landed. Should have used the call button for another drink! If price is good I would fly them again but I would definitely be more prepared with a meal purchased at the airport. The return flight was the same - invisible attendants except for initial drink. The gate attendant said we would receive a snack as the flight left at 6:30pm - guess what no snack just more nuts! Cannot rate food or entertainment. Entertainment was radio only with ear plug set passed out and collected before landing.	1
Several Flights domestic Mexico last March. MEX-CUN MEX-GDL MEX-VER. In general good price and good product for economy. Check in process in Mexico City fast and easy. Security control always very fast also no lines. Boarding process organized. On board always free snack. Departed and arrival on time most of the time only one time 10 min late. FA always nice. Bags fast on belt. Recommended.	1
Buenos Aires - Mexico - Las Vegas - Mexico - Buenos Aires. Most flights were on time and crew were friendly. For both long haul flights (EZE-MEX-EZE) the aircraft was a 767 without IFE. Food was quite good crew kept constantly giving out glasses of water tea or coffee even in MEX-EZE a 500ml bottle of water was on every economy class seat. If I get the chance I will fly them again.	1
I was rebooked with Aer lingus to Dublin after our BA flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional service offered. The aircraft was spotless fresh and bright. The crew kept us informed of our progress and had issued a very warm welcome on boarding. On the downside we had booked on a full service airline where drinks and a snack were included on Aer Lingus you pay. However the full breakfast I ordered was delicious and well worth the money. I look forward to booking with you in the future.	1
Overall: You get what you pay for. Cheap flight from IAD to IST via SVO. Flight was delayed from DC. No reason given or even boarding announcement. Strange things: inflight safety video on old 767 was set to techno music first in-flight movie on overhead screens was a 1940s black-and-white Soviet film with English subtitles and they serve drinks about 20 minutes before meals so you're thirsty again by the time you eat. Food was bad except for breakfast pancakes which were really good. Bring own food and entertainment.	1
Mumbai to Istanbul Sabiha via Sharjah. A320 with comfortable seat TVs on board for entertainment. The crew was polite and patient. After landing Sharjah I had to wait more than 12 hours for going to Istanbul. Airport is small but comfortable. I am satisfied with the services of Air Arabia and the cheap flight.	1
Sharjah to Beirut 55 Euros only. Sharjah airport consistently decaying and becoming more dirty every time. The aircraft this time was quite worn-out and not clean : seats windows. The major complaint would be the absence of free of charge water such as on some other LCC.	1
Athens to Frankfurt. Nice lounge at Athens with good selection of food. Flight average food terrible breakfast consisted of burnt pasty offering and a bread roll. Overall a fair offering but given the reviews was expecting more.	1
Thessaloniki-Samos return. Airbus A319 both ways. Flights full. Attentive crew nice flights drinks served for a 50 minutes flight. Recommended.	1
I flew from Mexico to Paris and Paris to Mexico. First flight was good I boarded in terminal 2 in Mexico city's international airport crew were smiling it was comfortable and food was excellent. Aircraft (B777-200) was good.	1
PVR-MEX Flight AM143 February 18 2013 Boeing 737-700 seat 22A. Flight half full we sat all ready to go in the cabin without air for a good 15 minutes before we were on our way. The aircraft had slim seats which tend to be the new trend with airlines to reduce weight and give a little more leg room. Leg room was OK but comfort of the seat is poor due to the lack of padding giving you some back pain even for a flight of a little over an hour. Drink service was OK staff friendly and attentive. Arrival on time.	1
Best experience I have had flying transatlantic. Flew round trip MCO-DUB 10/22 and returned 10/31. Continuing service to CDG. Very friendly and ever present staff on the transatlantic portion. The seat turned into an almost lay flat bed which provided a sound sleep in both directions. Wines were well chosen and poured frequently. Meals were well presented with a variety of appetizers before and hot breads during dinner. The staff service and the overall cleanliness of the plane convinced me that I had made the right choice for an airline. The connection DUB-CDG was a packed economy flight. For an hour and a half flight it was tolerable. Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on this route so everything including water is for sale. My choice from now on for transatlantic flights. Clearing customs and immigration in Dublin is a real plus. American customs and immigration are rude and hostile but about what you would expect from them.	1
JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.	1
DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.	1
DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.	1
"PRG-SVO-BKK. A smooth flight to SVO on a newish A320. Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot. Would certainly fly Aeroflot again."	1
I took Aeroflot SU2387 from ARN to SVO on 26 Mar and SU013 from LED to SVO on 31 Mar and I was pleasantly surprised with the cabin attendants who were well groomed courteous and able to communicate in standard English. The LED-SVO leg even had the bonus of the purser giving a brief of what one could see or do in Moscow. The meal services on both legs were conducted at lightning speed which I initially found worrisome as I was only halfway through my ARN-SVO meal when I saw the crew collecting the trays four rows away but I did see that the mainly Russian and Swedish passengers were already done eating so it was probably my pace that was the issue. For the prices I paid Aeroflot delivered exceptional value. I expected a Soviet relic but I experienced efficiency and service at its Russian best.	1
Istanbul-Sharjah-Delhi. Excellent experience and fare lower than on standard airlines. Well- designed and clear website. Clean planes and polite crew. Food available for purchase of board at very reasonable rate and of good quality.	1
Staff at Heathrow Airport not very helpful. Manager quite ignorant to people's needs. Cabin crew quite the opposite very polite and always smiling. A shame how one can spoil it for the other. If you have excess luggage I personally think they over charge. They charge £15.00 per kilo and believe me you cannot get away with it.	1
LHR-ATH return - A320 outbound A321 return. Excellent service and a good fare. Both aircraft's clean and comfortable with several rounds of drinks (wine tea coffee). Food good. Flights on time or ahead of schedule.	1
I loved flying Aegean Air from Rome to Athens in May 2011. Check in was a breeze. The food was warm and good even had dessert. Staff was courteous and helpful. After flying EasyJet for most parts of my 2 week European backpacking trip flying Aegean was a treat.	1
Flight from Shymkent to Kuala Lumpur via Almaty and back in April. On vacation we were hospitalized with fever and skipped our flight home. Air Astana appreciated our position and changed dates for our unreturnable tickets without charge, so we could come home later. Great thanks for help, now we are your loyal clients.	1
My flight from Sydney to São Paulo was cancelled and they called me to say they were having problems and if they could change my itinerary. They arranged everything for me with Emirates. My flight back to Australia was ok no delay. The food isn't good. No TVs but it is not a problem if you have magazines and books. The seats are not comfortable. The price is good however staff don't speak English very well. The check-in was very slow it took nearly 2 hours. Recommended if you to want save money.	1
"Dublin - New York Oct 26th: Early start for flight to NYC on EI105 ""St. Patrick"". Booked flight 6mts in advance for a hugely competitive £440 return. Major plus is clearing U.S. Immigration and Customs at T2 and hassle-free seamless arrival at T5 at JFK. Aircraft spotlessly clean new and unworn. Entered fleet in 2010 only. PTV screens were great with excellent documentaries although choice of good movies limited. Staff professional and efficient. Pilot is provided plenty of weather and routing information. Chose the pre-ordered chicken meal which I would highly recommend doing. Head and shoulders above the standard economy meal. Overall an excellent flight and experience. Could in no way fault."	1
Dublin to Frankfurt. Departed a little late but arrived in time. Comfortable flight (not full). Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew. Decent selection of food and drinks for sale. Overall cannot fault it and the price was very reasonable.	1
"EI775 Agadir - Dublin 12th October. Normally full of praise for Aer Lingus there seems to a general problem with inflight catering with Aer Lingus lately. They heavily advertise their new ""pre-booked meal service"" this is the 2nd time in 5 weeks that the meals were never loaded? Why offer something you can't provide food for purchase seems to always run out crew were ok but hassled not the normal friendly crew. Swissport the ground handlers are a disaster."	1
DUB to MAN one way. Very early flight but crew very friendly and helpful. Left on time but slight delay landing in Manchester due to fog. Pilot informative about weather throughout the flight. Flight very smooth with comfortable seating. Fly often with Aer Lingus and would highly recommend.	1
PVG-SVO-BEG. After flying in economy first time I decided to try out Aeroflot business as it was pretty cheap. Staff English pretty decent food good for my taste plenty of alcohol. Overall money spent well. SVO-BKK business class again I was happy with the level of service and comfort for the amount of money spent on a ticket. Shall use Aeroflot in future.	1
HAN-SVO-VIE return. All flights on time. Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board. Good value for money if you buy discounted biz- class. 3 of 4 flights on time only the last flight was delayed due to snowstorm in Moscow.	1
Heathrow to Larnaca return in October 2011. Excellent in every respect - new clean aircraft relaxed and attentive service.	1
LHR - Mykonos rtn via Athens both ways. 30 minute delay outbound from LHR meant connection was very tight in Athens. Cabin crew provided reassurance to anxious passengers (one crew member saying 'Aegean Airlines cares for its passengers don't worry) and at Athens those of us with tight connections were met by a lady who competently and at very high speed escorted us through what is a complex connecting arrangement. No delays on the return service and we landed 15 minutes early at LHR. Service onboard was good with a hot meal and a free bar. On the way from LHR to ATH we had a new A321 aircraft with in flight entertainment (main screen). Otherwise flights were on a mix of A319 and A320 of varying ages. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights with them the crew work hard and seem proud of their airline.	1
26 April Tashkent-Almaty flight KS128 and 5th May Almaty-Tashkent flight KS127. Embraer 160 from Tashkent-Almaty-Tashkent. Excellent service on Board. It was at a high level starting from check-in to landing. Flight attendants were very neat and friendly also pleased with the print media. Even given candy during takeoff and landing as well as a pillow which were very nice.	1
Flight from London on time 767 aircraft with new interior. clean and well presented crew efficient and helpful Food and alcohol selection great seat very comfortable and inflight entertainment console worked well. Arrived on time and fresh. This is a great connection for Kazakhstan.	1
Flew twice on domestic flights in Argentina and despite all the bad reviews these flights were excellent on time and without any issues. One was operated by Austral on a new airplane which had comfortable seats with IFE in back seat. I may have been lucky but I can recommend them for domestic flights.	1
Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.	1
MTY-MEX-PVG-MEX-MTY. Departed MTY Terminal B very nice fast check in. Boarded a brand new 737-800 with IFE in Biz and coach classes. In MEX went to the AM lounge - its excellent. Boarded (777-200ER) sat in Premier Class all the way to PVG. It has a tech stop over TIJ which turned out not so bad you don't even get off the plane at TIJ just crew changes and on we went to Shanghai. It was a 14.45 min flight but sleeping eating movies and great crews made my flight amazing!	1
Flew from Miami to Cabo through Mexico City. I was very hesitant but chose to do so as I was taking 5 people with me and it was $250.00 cheaper pp to fly Aeromexico than the other domestic airlines. My experience turned out to be a very pleasant one. Other than legroom being a little tight in economy on 2 of the 4 flights planes were clean on time staff very pleasant and flight attendants dressed well. Mexico City airport was very easy to manage. My experience was just as good if not better than any other domestic airline.	1
Flew AeroMexico for the first time in economy class from JFK to Cancun return. Aside from the legroom or lack of I can't make any negative comments. We were given a pretty good breakfast half hour into the flight nice hot coffee and flight attendents made multiple beverage runs throughout the 3.5hr flt. The return was pretty much the same except it was a dinner flight and they offered complimentary alcohol. I'd say AeroMexico is a much better airline to travel to Mexico in economy class then US carriers.	1
We flew Boston to Dublin and back. Flight 136 Sep 15 2013. Flight 137 Sep 27 2013. Excellent flights excellent crew! Aer Lingus will be our airline for overseas travel. Highly recommended.	1
MAN-MCO Business Class Sep 2013. One cannot praise Aer Lingus enough the flights were excellent as were the meals on board. Aircraft's were spotlessly clean and good service from start to finish. The only draw back was that we could not find lounge at MCO as it was United's in another part of airport.	1
LAX-SVO: Round-trip: Feb 6-12 2013. Frankly not so bad considering the price. Pros: Relatively comfortable. Direct flight. Cons: boarding is badly organized especially in SVO cheap wine in tetrapaks only paper glasses food choices are limited to two items.	1
AMS-SVO-HKG. First experience with a Russian airline. Aircraft new A320 and A330 reasonably on time. SVO terminal F horrible more like a busy bus terminal. Seat comfortable PTV with a limited choice. Staff attitude OK (didn't really expect too much in this part of the world). Would fly them again as they offer a decent product for a low cost.	1
LHR-ATH-LHR Business Class. Flight was comfortable with reasonably good service. On return trip breakfast was extremely good - much better than the lunch on the outward leg. No significant delays even though Greek ATC was working to rule.	1
Athens-Chios-Athens Economy. Despite this being only a 20 minute flight it's operated by an A320. Very few passengers on it on outward leg but quite busy on return with large number of pax transiting Athens en route to US and Canada having been back home for summer. Service was okay - early morning flight so we were offered coffee/ soft drink and chocolate croissant. Check in at Athens was very efficient. Chios is the smallest airport I have experienced but everything went very smoothly - even in a very cramped check in area there was no long delay getting luggage checked in and boarding cards issued.	1
I recently flew return from BKK to ALA. It was the first time I've flown Air Astana and I have to say that I was delighted with the attentive anticipatory levels of service I received. The plane itself looked brand new the business class cabin was spotless and a true delight to sit in. While the inflight entertainment was not as extensive as higher profile airlines this wasn't an issue for me. The dining experience was excellent quality varied food presented fantastically. The service and the environment along with the punctuality made this an excellent first experience of an airline that is clearly having an effect in the region.	1
MEX-MIA on a Boeing 737-800. Full flight and despite this the airline manages to board everyone very quickly. The crew of Aeromexico have a very high Uniform standard and are very professional. On this 2.5 hour flight I was offered a complete breakfast drinks including alcoholic drinks newspapers and headphones. Their Hub in Mexico City is definitely the best terminal in North America.	1
Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.	1
MAN-SNN SNN-JFK JFK-DUB DUB-MAN. Got a great deal on the ticket price very comfortable A330 planes on the long haul segments with seat-back IFE with a great selection of movies and music very helpful and friendly crew and decent food/drink selection. All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.	1
IST-SVO-IST. Check-in at IST was total chaos plane arrived on time at SVO and on the return the plane left on time from SVO. Check-in at SVO was brilliant no chaos we waited for about 1 minute. Both inflight to and from SVO food was awful. Quite confusing to see that complimentary drinks are served in advance of meal. Attendants not smiling but are very professional and try to help as much as they can. Plane was an Airbus albeit the plane on the online sales was shown as IL96 Turbo. Plane didn't look very clean. A great deal in means of price but don't expect much!	1
FRA-SVO-HAV in Dec 2012. FRA check-in was chaos 2 counters were very slow moving. SVO connecting was very smooth - it took less than 10 mins for passport check and security check. SVO-HAV 13 hours flight by A330. Economy class first 4 row of IFE didn't work. Seat (12D) pitch was wider than 52 inches. I am 184cm and it was enough to stretch my legs. This is more important than IFE for me. Every hour a drink and snack service by cart. Crews never smiled but worked well.	1
Return Madrid - St Petersburg via Moscow. Absolutely happy with the service (especially taking into account the price as it was one of the cheapest options). All flights on time efficient boarding procedures nice good quality meals. The crew is attentive and friendly (we flew Aeroflot in December 2011 and could see a big improvement in the quality of the service over the year). New aircraft and comfy seats.	1
I flew 4 flights with them over the summer and everyone of them was delayed. I am aware there are air traffic control restrictions so may not be the airlines fault. However I feel they are crafty as we were just getting up to a 3 hour delay when they boarded us only to sit on the plane for ages so they would not have to pay any compensation. On the plus side the fleet is modern and new. On all but one of the flights the cabin crew were helpful smart and smiling. I found the food to be adequate although no choice. You can check in online 48 hours before the flight and also book emergency row seats for no extra charge.	1
Flight KC929 20 February. Was an overnight flight. Flight left on time and cabin crew were extremely thoughtful. Placed blanket over me while sleeping and when woke even though food service had finished and on way to landing - they found an apple to give me. Was a great experience and very impressed by cabin crew attitude.	1
I found this routing from HK-Almaty very convenient and have done it a couple of times now. Direct flight airport close to city and city close to ski fields. Great value for money. Well maintained aircraft good attention to service - what more do you need.	1
Auckland-Buenos Aires return on A340. Both flights were delayed no reason was given as to why; communication would have been appreciated. There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options. I had an internal flight in Argentina on LAN Chile and they appeared to be a more polished act.	1
Had a wonderful experience flying Aer Lingus from Boston to Dublin and from Dublin to Chicago. Both trips were effortless and the customer service was top notch. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I also flew this airline between Dublin and Paris and had a positive experience as well.	1
Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.	1
Dublin - Malaga return. Outbound on 05/09/13 on A330. All aspects of this flight was excellent. Flight on time seats were comfortable and staff excellent. Only gripe was delay in getting baggage in Malaga airport. Return on 17/09/13 on A320. Seats were a bit hard but ok for a 3 hour flight. Staff again friendly and helpful and flight on time. Baggage on carousel on arrival. Aer Lingus is definitely my preferred carrier out of Ireland.	1
Flew today Moscow SVO to Amsterdam. Easy check in easy to find the lounge which offered basic refreshments. The big surprise was our flight offered champagne or OJ as we sat down flight crew very friendly short delay as wings were de-iced and the purser took our drink orders and meal preferences at that time. The seats were comfy the portable digital handheld entertainment worked well and easily. On time. We also got a small toiletries bag and a luggage tag. I have no complaints and would highly recommend in the future.	1
ATH-SVO-VNO and what a pleasant surprise it was. ATH-SVO a well maintained A320 almost fully packed with very good pitch and a very friendly crew. Very nice uniforms. Tasteful food and choices available. Refreshments for free with refills alcohol at a charge. Arrival in SVO but no jetway available it was snowing so the stairs became a bit tricky. SVO-VNO on a Sukhoi Superjet. Seats a bit hard but it was only a 75 minutes flight. Dinner was served. Friendly crew. 15 minutes delay but with this kind of weather it was nothing.	1
LHR-ATH-LHR. Super Flight great crew I was even offered a chance to see the captain. Great movie and lovely food good choice of duty free items lounge was comfortable.	1
CDG-RUN return. Air Austral is the airline of Réunion Island owned by the local public authorities. On the good side food is average but not too bad particularly main dishes. FA are smiling and very attentive ground staff really nice. Boarding was very well organised. A small travel kit is provided with socks. Pillows are wide. Cabin looks fine although a bit ageing in Y. New livery on the planes is really great. On the downside choice of films on the IFE is surprisingly limited and most French films - and seats are really narrow because of 3-4-3 configuration on B777 particularly exit seats. All in all I find its service to be slightly better than AF and Air Mauritius on this area.	1
Sydney-Reunion-CDG return May/June 2012. After reading mixed reviews here we were a little apprehensive at first but booked anyway because of price and also short stop over times. Staff were friendly upon initial check in blocking the seat next to us so we had more room. Actually the only flight we had to sit next to someone else was Reunion-CDG. Entertainment selection was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was tasty and very sufficient. And the care packs with socks ear plugs sleep mask and headphones were a nice touch. On return flight Reunion-Sydney the plane was virtually empty so we had a row of seats each as did most other passengers in the cabin. Again staff were very attentive constantly offering drinks throughout the flight. All in all we had an extremely pleasant experience and have no hesitation flying with them again. Have recommended Air Austral and will continue to.	1
IST-TSE-BKK (and back) on A321 and B767 first airplane saws its years the other one is great new and comfortable. The service from the staff was great. Very personalized friendly and they spoke fluent English. There was not IFE on A321 but 2 movies were on drop down screens. Excellent IFE on B767 with HD screens and good variety of movies TV series games. Food was very tasty and plenty of alcoholic drinks beverages coffee/tea. They offer newspapers and amenities kits. Great airline to fly with TSE airport small but new and clean.	1
I flew to San Jose Costa Rica from SFO via Mexico City. The first leg was extremely hot as the AC was turned off. However the subsequent legs were good. Beer was free and so were the meals. Overall the service was much better than American domestic airlines.	1
My husband and I were delayed in Guadalajara by 1.25 hours because of engine problems which meant we would miss our connection in Puerta Vallarta to Calgary with WestJet. Aeromexico ground staff in Guad made it possible for us to catch our connecting flight. We were met in P.V. on the tarmac and were personally escorted through the airport rushed through immigration phone calls were made to ensure that our luggage had been transferred and we made it onto the WestJet flight with only 5 minutes to spare. We had a hotel and rental car booked and paid for in Calgary so we had to get there and we did.	1
Excellent flight on Aer Lingus from BOS-CDG clean comfortable aircraft staffed by the best cabin attendants on all segments. Very easy connections at DUB. Aer Lingus is my transatlantic airline of choice.	1
Recently flew from Boston to Shannon (EI-134) on board a very comforting Airbus A330 wide body. On boarding the aircraft at Boston Logan Airport for our flight we were greeted by a very welcoming flight crew. The aircraft was well maintained and very clean. As soon as we departed Boston beverage service was served. Complimentary soft drinks served but alcohol was not free which is ok. Dinner service began about 1 hour after departing and we were served chicken or beef. The meal service was delicious. Flight crew came around during dinner service with more beverages and water. More food available if we desired. Entertainment was excellent plenty of choices for movies. I have to say Aer Lingus is a wonderful airline with great service.	1
PRG to BKK in business. Great fare so switched my natural BA allegiance. Good food some fun with crew. Entertainment on A330 OK to pass some time. Laughs with crew and seat row ordering my drinks in Russian but everyone appreciated my poor efforts so I never went thirsty. Lounges in SVO are poor and crowded. Nice sandwiches though. Transit change is easy to do. SU are a good alternative to AY for Asia flights. All flights on time and everything felt very safe.	1
I use Aeroflot pretty often on my flights from Vienna to Bangkok Hong Kong and domestic flights in Russia. All flights were on time. Onboard service was great. Comfortable seats and great entertainment plenty of movies music and games. New Airbus A330-300 as well the Airbus 320 very pleasant and comfortable. Overall very good experience great value for money and I strongly recommend it.	1
LHR-ATH-CFU return. Good planes seats and food. All on time. Let down only by the crew who though very glamorous were a bit clueless. On both long legs I attempted to get a second drink - all met with nods and smiles - to no avail. The Business lounge in Athens was good.	1
LHR-LCA return in Economy. Cabin crew were attentive and professional. The food was tasteful and drinks distributed 3 times during the flight. Punctual latest aircraft clean.	1
Professional service. There was a delay of 1 hour from Crete to Athens however we received a voucher for a free domestic flight.	1
"Departed Jorge Newbury Airport (AEP) Buenos Aires to Galeão-(GIG) Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252- 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight ""snack"" was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet."	1
Excellent trip between New Caledonia and St Denis of La Reunion. Onward and return on a Boeing 747 with good comfort on seats. Individual screens. Excellent service and good meals. The pitch was just too little for me and that's why I just give 9 and not 10.	1
Mauritius to Reunion return. Onward flight was on a Boeing 737-800 with only a 20% load so we had enough space during that 20 mins flight. Service was a cookie and juice which was nice. Return flight was on a ATR 72 aircraft with the same service. Crew was friendly and helpful. Flights and bags where on time. Would fly them again even ticket price is quite high.	1
In the last year I have flown Air Astana on 14 different legs now (ALA-SGN ALA-BKK-SGN ALA-ICH and ALA-DEL). During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future. Overall I say Air Astana is a good carrier to choose nowadays.	1
I took six flights over two weeks London-Astana Astana-Almaty and Almaty to Tashkent and all of them were very good and I was impressed with the staff quality of food and video/TV system. The flight between Astana and London both ways wasn't very busy and the planes were very modern and well maintained. It was a pleasure and relaxing to fly with them.	1
"MEX-MAD 777 in Business Class! Fast and efficient check-in quick security checkpoint crossing and amazing VIP Lounge! Efficient Priority boarding and onboard nice big lie flat ""pod"" seats! Very good IFE and delicious food with nice staff. Nice quiet smooth flight with lots of entertainment."	1
I flew from Manchester to Dublin (MAN-DUB) and Dublin to Manchester (DUB-MAN) with Aer Lingus. I did not experience any problems. The cabin crew and gate staff seemed okay but the onboard food and drink was a little overpriced. Overall I was quite satisfied with the service delivered by Aer Lingus for my short flight to Dublin and back I would travel with Aer Lingus again.	1
Los Angeles to Moscow and back every year. Direct flight. The airline has improved tremendously in the last 10 years. Now I find it adequate and on par with any of the lower price international carriers. Bring your own entertainment and snacks though.	1
PEK-SVO-TXL business class. PEK-SVO in A330-300. New seats comfortable but not lie flat. Cabin was very clean and modern. Staff efficient but not overly friendly - which is to be expected. Head FA did ask me how I should be addressed and stuck to that preference. Food was fair and there was certainly plenty (6 courses). Drink selection good. AVOD was average - not the greatest selection but enough to please. Transfer at SVO was very easy. Lounge at SVO was average - ok food drinks and good wifi. SVO-TXL on an A320. Immaculate condition of plane and the staff/inflight meals were excellent for a 2.5 hour flights. FAs handed out portable players for flight which is great. Very impressive short-haul service. Overall an excellent value for money considering most of the other carriers were charging more for an economy seat.	1
"Moscow - Havana - Moscow. Both flights on time luggage reached the destination. Clean new Airbus A330 pillow and blanket provided. Inflight entertainment system very good however mine was broken after 4 hours on flight to Havana. Restarting the system helped but then the handset stopped working as well so the system was useless. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Big minus for the food which was awful. Beverages were good although there was no alcohol on this route. Very difficult to understand the ""Russian"" English during the announcements. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of poor food (which is important during the 12 hrs flight) the rest was very good especially the price."	1
NOU-RUN-MRS return. The overall service and meals were beyond expectations for a French airline crews were polite professional and present throughout the cabin. All flights with brand new B773 are pleasant with PTV's and conformable seats. The only flight with B772 was on the MRS-RUN leg and it was a shame because no PTV on this ageing aircraft. However the transit area in Saint Denis La Réunion airport definitely needs to be revamped there is nothing Air Austral can do about it but I hope this will be modernised shortly.	1
MRU-RUN-SYD-NOU return. High level of service across the board. No difference between flying on an ATR 72-500 and a B777-300. The crew were well groomed polite and efficient. Great Creole cuisine with a French savoir fare. Hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between. On Demand Entertainment System worked well with plenty of choices. International magazines available. Clean lavatories.	1
SYD-CDG return. I have travelled to Europe several times and never look forward to it. Booking and check-in no problem staff and service was very good. The addition of a TGV ticket to get me closer to my destination was much appreciated and connection was easy. My only quibble was a limited entertainment selection.	1
Bangkok-Almaty on 5 Oct 2014 KC932 and return Almaty-Bangkok on 12 Oct 2014 KC931. Check-in staff were friendly and speak good English. The B757 used was clean and have a new look about it. The IFE was reasonably good with offerings of some of the latest films. The cabin crew was friendly helpful and attentive. The overnight flight from Almaty to Bangkok took off at around 1 am. About two hours into the flight a full meal was served. Before landing in Bangkok at around 8.45 a.m. no breakfast was served. For a flight like this suggest that two light meals be served – one shortly after take-off and breakfast before landing. Overall it was a pleasant experience flying with Air Astana.	1
Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.	1
Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food. It seemed a little strange serving dinner at about 2.00am! It would be better to offer breakfast when flights depart after 11.30 at night. Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.	1
Three flights around Central Asia this last week. FRU-ALA ALA-TSE and TSE-AUH. The FRU-ALA flight was so short they offer a cabin drinks service on the ground. ALA-TSE we were offered a drink and small snack on the B757 overhead screens played a silent sketch show. TSE-AUH was on an A320. A full cabin service was offered. Entertainment was on overhead screen and amenity packs were provided. One movies and a couple TV shows. Leg room was good on all sectors. Staff all spoke English. But check-in always seemed to be chaotic.	1
The planes left on time and arrived on time seats and legroom are good. A340's don't have entertainment main cabin TV screens are old. Air hostess hide once they serve you you hardly see them - they disappear. This is poor as people have to go and ask for water etc it becomes a kind of self serve Airline. For the price is good.	1
Buenos Aires-Iguazu Falls return. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed 10 mins early and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew friendly. The return flight on an MD-88 old but in good condition quiet and comfortable with a friendly and helpful cabin crew with the flight arriving at Aeroparque (AEP) 10 mins early.	1
Great service from Houston to San Pedro Sula in Honduras. Great staff friendly and helpful employees and easy to navigate Terminal 2 in Mexico City and Terminals D and E/F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.	1
Have flown Aer Lingus nearly every year. Every flight I have flown is excellent. My most recent was from Milan Linate to Dublin. Flight was on time and all went smooth with luggage etc. All members of staff were helpful and accommodating. Food was good for aeroplane standard and was reasonably priced for being on a plane. Seats and leg space are excellent for economy class. I am once again flying with Aer Lingus in 2 weeks time to Lisbon from the excellent Dublin airport terminal 2. It is a brand new terminal. A great value airline.	1
GVA-SVO-Hanoi NRT-SVO-GVA on Business Class. All planes were clean seats were comfortable food delicious and CAs friendly. I was worried about the transfer at the SVO but it went smoothly at both passport control and security. The SVO terminals which I used ie Terminal D (for long flights) and F (inter European flights) were connected and seemed to be walking through miles of duty free shops with little seats. Will try again in economy class as far as business class is concerned I think their product is at the same level of most European big companies such as KLM and SAS and definitely superior to US carriers.	1
My flight with Aeroflot was really a pleasant one. I flew with them from Amsterdam to Moscow and then on to St Petersburg. Flights departed before the scheduled departure time (all flights) and they landed before the scheduled arrival time. Flights were on their very comfortable Airbus A319 and A320's. The legroom was sufficient for someone of my height (I am 1.81 meters) and the inflight service the food was excellent. Hot meals and alcohol were standard. Cabin crew could have been a bit more cheerful (they didn't smile at all) however they were okay in their politeness and they did their job fine. All in all great flights and I would definitely use them again.	1
I fly around 10 times each year to domestic and European destinations Aegean is my preferred airline for many years now I never had a problem except once where there was a delay of 1hr but they issued a free ticket for me and my wife so I can't complain. Aircraft's always clean stuff friendly and kind. They are a top airline with very good service.	1
ATH-SKG ATH-AXD ATH-JMK. Aegean was quite good: flight attendants were nice food was OK the pilot was good when he explained to us that we would be delayed. The only problem was there wasn't enough room for my bag on the plane so somehow it ended up in security and it took 1/2 hr to find it!	1
SYD to Mauritius. Excellent service and quite comfortable for Economy class. Flight attendants friendly always coming through the cabin with water. Plenty of food provided.	1
Sydney to Noumea Business Class. Fast check in at Sydney Airport they use the Qantas Club which was nice. Boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft. Business Class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled. Crew spoke mainly French and some broken English - but they are a French Airline. Food good service attentive and friendly didn't use the inflight entertainment. Overall not a bad product.	1
Paris to St-Denis (Reunion) in Business Class. Seat is comfortable food is perfect and staff very friendly. In St-Denis lounge we got champagne and apetizers vry nice. Compared to Air France this company is excellent!	1
7 Feb from ALA To IST. I travel internationally and domestically frequently. Based on my experience Air Astana is a cut above the rest. As a person who is afraid of flying it is a pleasure to see the rapid modernization of the fleet. I am 193cm tall and leg room is important for me Air Astana usually offers the most. The inflight entertainment is current and changes frequently. Lastly I have found the cabin crew to be very supportive. there was one occasion where I complained about the temperature of the cabin being too hot and the senior flight attendant had a customer complaint book where she recorded my complaint. A great initiative which I have never experienced on other airlines.	1
All in all its OK for a relatively short journey and the food's nice. But you should know this: I travel a number of times a year TSE-FRA and am finding more frequent delays with no information given. The last 3 times there were 40 minute-2 hour delays so beware! Quite a lot of confusion at FRA last time when the plane was 90% filled with a single group of Chinese travelling to Urumqi. Don't take a window seat in winter - the a/c isn't up to it and there's an arctic draft every time. Inflight entertainment not much only overhead screens and reruns of candid camera type stuff and one movie repeated on 6 hour flight. Internally in KZ the prices are ridiculously high because they are the only airline which is up to international standards.	1
Ala-Astana KC 683 back Astana Almaty KC 954 Almaty-Atyrau (Guriev) - KC 889B Atyrau (Guriev) - Almaty KC 890-B. Good service. Perfect take off and landings. Air Astana continues to work on their services and airfleet and I continue to see an ongoing positive development of the company. Some destinations are more expensive than others but generally good value for money.	1
Buenos Aires-Madrid. Staff were helpful and friendly. Seats comfortable but there is no onboard entertainment and the plane was old.	1
Ezeiza to Iguazu the plane was quite new a 737-700. No delay at all the flight was nice although no headphones were given. Seats are comfortable for such a small flight 1.45 hrs.	1
I have flown 4 Aeromexico flights in the past 6 months two roundtrips from Mexico City to Chicago and all 4 flights were excellent. One flight left 30 minutes late yet managed to arrive on time. The others left on time and arrived either on time or early. Newspapers and either breakfast or a light lunch onboard. Very friendly flight crews. No problems at all.	1
MEX-MAD. Flight left on time. Aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 in a very good condition. Cabin looked spacious and clean. Seat was ok but sleeping was not easy as it was angled. Moreover the config was 2-3-2 so if sat in the middle and pax next to you are asleep you have to jump over them. AVOD system was reliable. The food was tasty as Aeromexico have started a new collaboration with a group of chefs. There was also an express dining option for those of us who wanted to sleep. The crew were attentive and helpful with high uniform standards. They responded effectively to customer needs and were constantly through the cabin offering drinks and top ups. Two hours before landing breakfast was served. Flight landed in MAD on time. Great flight and exceeded expectations.	1
MAD-MEX Economy class. Check in was a bit disorganized in Terminal 1 of Madrid. Terminal was very busy due to the summer holidays no sitting at the gate Terminal 1 has very poor services for travellers. Boarding was on time and done in a very organized way. Legroom was reasonable food was very nice and service was outstanding. Cabin crews were very polite and caring. Landing on time. Baggage came with 15 mins delay due to a shortage in transporting vehicles.	1
London Heathrow - ORK. Fly regularly on this route - such a great alternative to other low cost airlines. Flight took off from London early and arrived early and same for the return. Cabin crew friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Food for purchase was good value and tasty. I have flown over 20 times with Aer Lingus and never had a bad experience. Assigned seating comfortable seats and great crew - makes flying a breeze.	1
BHX-DUB day return 15 June 2013. As a fearful flyer trying to overcome it this was a pair of practice flights for me. Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service. Do airlines realise how much of a good impression caring cabin crew give? Will definitely be flying with this airline again!	1
NRT-SVO-IST and BEG-SVO-NRT. NRT-SVO(333) Check-in was smooth. Lounge at NRT (Delta) was comfortable. Cabin was clean. Seat was comfortable. CAs were friendly. Food was very good. it was a nice flight. SVO-IST(321) 1 hour delay. It's not bad. BEG-SVO (320) Check in started 2 hours before the flight. Lounge was good. CAs were friendly. Food was good. SVO-NRT(333) Connection was smooth. Newest 333's seat was very comfortable for sleep. Not sliding down. Cabin was clean. CAs were very friendly. Food was excellent. It was a quite nice flight. Problem was logistics at the airport.	1
RGN-SNW. Quick boarding with allocated seating for 45 minute flight in ATR72 to Ngapali Beach. Good safety briefing before time take off and light snack and drink en route. Pleasant FA's smooth flight and great landing over the surf and through the palm trees to this small exRAF WW11 strip on the Bay of Bengal. Luggage is delivered by handcart to the entrance gates-expect to pay 500kyat per piece.	1
Flew 2 internal flights in Burma with this local airline. Surprisingly new plane pretty much on time and with very pleasant crews. Also served a good snack gave out towels although flights were only about 45 minutes. Was a bit reticent about using them but very pleasantly surprised.	1
SKG-STR A320. Everything worked well despite air traffic control strikes in Greece. It was anyway one of the best medium-haul flights. Online-Check-In efficient baggage-drop-off at the counter - no queues. We had to leave Thessalonika before 6pm because of the strikes. Plane arrived late so they really did a good job to turn the plane around in 20 mins. Cabin clean proper looking. Comfortable seating. Great service with a warm meal and a wide choice of beverages. Staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. Arrived on time. Great!	1
Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent! Cabin crew were attentive meal good and aircraft/cabin condition clean and modern.	1
MEL to MRU via Sydney and Reunion with Air Austral. Overall nice experience although the flight is long. On the long haul flight meals are quite good and there are quite a lot of things on the platter. Before landing a snack is served. Sandwiches and beverages are provided during the whole flight. On short haul drinks only are served. Flight attendants are quite efficient but can barely speak English fluently. No individual screens.	1
Flew Air Austral Syd-Run-Mauritius-Run-Syd – it is 100% better then Air Mauritius. The food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly. I’ve got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us - free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok. The only drawback is theres no PTV and not much info from cockpit.	1
I fly Air Astana very often almost every week nowadays. I find the experience with new 767 ER relaxing though the flights between Astana and Almaty are always full. The ground staff keep improving. Seems new planes brought a fresh spirit on board. 767 Business Class is great and gives privacy to the customers. Looking forward to flying the Dreamliner. Food is much better than before.	1
KC 951 21 May. KC 856 21 May. I fly Air Astana very often. I find the experience relaxing though the flights between Istanbul and Almaty are usually full. The leg room is good. I think the mileage program could be improved where you could upgrade using your miles during check-in. The food is usually fresh though could be improved. Inflight entertainment is weak and needs improvement. Overall good value for money.	1
My first flight with Air Astana - London-Astana return. It was a great experience. Friendly staff and excellent service comfortable seat nice and generous food. AirAstana will be my first choice from now on.	1
As a family we have flown with Air Astana numerous times (both in economy and business class) since moving to Kazakhstan and have always been happy with the level of service. We travel with a young child and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.	1
Sydney to Buenos Aires and had heard all the stories so I was prepared when there was an 8 hr delay in Auckland and for the broken seat and dodgy entertainment. But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class. I was finally able to sleep and the service from the crew were great.	1
MIA-MEX roundtrip on Boeing 737-800 both legs. Crew professional offering drinks and refills. Hot breakfast on morning flight and full meal on afternoon flight back. I was offered a headset and newspapers. Both flights on time.	1
April 2nd 2013 Economy. BHX-DUB. This was my seventh flight with Aer Lingus and again they didn't disappoint. The cabin crew were excellent very friendly helpful and caring. The aircraft was an A320 and was clean and smart with the seats having good legroom and comfort. The flight was slightly late but the Captain was very informative and gave full route details. I can't comment on the food and beverages as I had none. Overall this flight was very comfortable.	1
Odessa to Moscow and Moscow to Mineralnye Vody (code share with Don Avia). The flights were like chalk and cheese. The early flight from Odessa was on time efficient check in and an adequate breakfast. Seats OK and no in flight entertainment. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Second flight was originally delayed by 90 minutes and then by another 5 hours and another 2 hours after that. Meal voucher was given (inadequate for a reasonable meal given airport prices) but no real apology and explanations in English lacking. Soon after takeoff I moved seats and slept so no comments possible about staff - they seemed not to speak much English. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of the delay on the Moscow - Mineralnye Vody sector.	1
Bangkok - Moscow - Simferopol. Flights departed and arrived on time. The crew was professional and reasonable friendly. The level of English was more than adequate. The hand held entertainment systems between Bangkok and Moscow were rather dated and substandard for a business class cabin. There was no entertainment on the shorter Moscow - Simferopol sector. From Bangkok to Moscow the cabin was almost full but service standards were maintained. Food was good. From Moscow to Simferopol the cabin the crew served a good meal on the short flight.	1
Flew on four separate legs within Myanmar and found them to be surprisingly good. You don't normally expect catering on flights of under an hour but there was something on all segments. Arrived in good time at Heho Airport for a flight to Yangon and they automatically put me on to an earlier departure. There is a certain amount of third world amateurism about the boarding process but it all seemed to work.	1
Ground service is terrible compared to in the air. Manual check-in process with no computers. This airline seems to be the only one to have a lounge in the domestic terminal in Yangon. Air-conditioned and friendly associates offering a cheese croissant. No bathroom inside so that was a drag. People in Lotus class got a private van to the plane which was nice compared to cramming onto a bus. Onboard the flight was pretty good. The front of the plane is much quieter compared to the back. Their inflight magazine was pretty decent and the english grammatically correct. Even on short flights they gave you food. On my YGN-MDY flight which was about 50 minutes they served a full breakfast. Seats were pretty comfortable on par with United A320 first class seats. I don't really see the need for inflight entertainment on such short flights.	1
ATH-LHR on A321. Toys were given out to kids before take off. Many passengers had ordered special diets but FA managed to deliver our meals as quick as possible. Always ask if you need a second bread. Hot meal with one choice (beef brisket with rice) and I am amazed how they prepare such a Hong Kong style cuisine! Seats 3x3 not very spacious but good enough for flights less than 4 hours.	1
London Heathrow - Larnaca. I found Aegean's price reasonable and A320 was very comfortable. The crew were happy to help and free meals were included which was nice. Great that Heathrow Terminal 4 is used too. Cannot fault.	1
KC621 Almaty-Astana 22/4/2014. Flown old Boeing 757 in business. Old chairs/layout. Plenty of legroom good for sitting and on a short flight less than 2 hours no need to lie down. A full meal was served on this short flight. A very nice vegetarian meal. No entertainment available or offered. No business lounge available on domestic fights.	1
KC856 Astana-Almaty 24/4/2014. Flown new Boeing 767 in business. Good new chairs (fully flat nice big touch LCD- screens) and modern interior. Nice choice of entertainment. And much to my surprise a full meal on a flight less than two hours. Good vegetarian meal. Pity they do not have business lounges on domestic flights.	1
I travel very frequently on Air Astana from Delhi-Almaty. Check-in staff at Delhi and Almaty are very efficient. I had a wonderful experience on 18 April flying from Delhi to Almaty. The flight crew went out of their way to take care of passengers needs.	1
April 4 KC951 from Almaty to Astana. Return April 4 from Astana to Almaty KC854. Had the pleasure of flying Air Astanas new 767 service between Astana and Almaty. It was the best domestic economy class service I have flown. Each seat has in seat videos with the latest films tv music etc. I had a choice of international newspapers as well as a warm sandwich and drink. As usual the crew were smiling multi lingual and well dressed. The seats had a good tilt.	1
There seems to be a polarity of views on AR between Australia/New Zealand based travellers and those who use AR regularly for domestic and regional services. It may be the case that both are right but for fairness I have to say that in 15 yrs of domestic flights and regional services to/from Brazil and Paraguay I have never experienced more than 30 mins delay and have always received good service in Economy class.	1
AGU-MEX-JFK E170/B737-800 in economy plus. Aeromexico had the lowest walk-up fare and still acceptable connection in Mexico City. Onboard service professional occasionally smiling and frequently offering beverages. T2 Terminal in MEX is comfortable and acceptable eating and other amenities. MEX-JFK a hot meal and beverages incl alcohol and newspapers/magazines. FAs were curt. The only downside to AM is that they are rarely competitive on fares relative to American Airlines CO and US on advance purchases.	1
We flew Boston Logan to Dublin and Shannon to Boston on Aer Lingus. It was our first experience on this airline and we were very pleased. The planes were A330-200s and were clean and in good condition. Very good entertainment choices. Food was standard airline fare. I didn't order the upgraded meal because I didn't think it would be any better but from comments that I've heard next time I probably will next time. Flight attendants were friendly.	1
"On the Dublin to Chicago flight on the Friday returning Tuesday late afternoon. Nothing bad at all outbound on time departure and arrival flight crew were excellent ordered the ""Extra "" menu for Euro and it was worth every penny. Flight back you cannot order the extra menu which is a great shame again the flight crew were open friendly and very professional - flight left late and arrived very early. Couldn't fault them at all - spot on. Well done to Aer Lingus."	1
Milan Malpensa to Tokyo via Moscow - July 25 2012. Friendly staff on board less so on the ground. A330 new efficient with good entertainment on board.	1
DEL-SVO SVO-KRR KRR-SVO and SVO-DEL. DEL-SVO was late by more than 6 hours and as per the airline rules we should have got a hotel stay. Instead we had to spend the whole 6.5 hours at the IGI T3. Supposed to board an A330-200 which was unfortunately unavailable so we boarded a A330-300 with wide and comfortable seats and on-board entertainment facility! An hour after take off came the drinks. Then the main- course followed by a delicious cake and a cup of tea or coffee. All flights were smooth and flight staff courteous. In all my experience was very good.	1
AMS-SVO check in opens 2.5 hrs before long lines online check in was not possible. Flight boarded on time it was a A321 instead of the scheduled A320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. Welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. After take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. For business seats for European business good service should be better. DIGI player was good for a 3.5 hr flight.	1
Yangon-Bagan. ATR-72. Decent plane old and tired but as you'd expect from an airline in Burma. There was 1 cabin crew member and the co-pilot. Very pleasant service and a nice cheese croissant for the flight. Completely empty so you could stretch out over two seats which is important for me being 6ft 3.	1
Chiang Mai to Yangon return and pleasantly surprised by the standard - fairly new aircraft and meal service for 50 minute flight. Flight attendants were somewhat offhand. Reasonable leg room in economy.	1
Four internal flights in the last three weeks. Three on time one an hour late and this because a party of VIPs decided to turn up an hour after the scheduled take-off time. All flights satisfactory. Planes in OK condition. Even on short flights we were served refreshments. Nothing computerised and the whole process completed manually. When joining flights outside Yangon (the starting point for most flights) there is 'free' seating. This is because the systems are unable to work out which seats are vacated at each stop.	1
ATH-LHR economy. Very comfortable seats excellent meal clean and new aircraft and in-flight entertainment. Frequent flyer department are sometimes a bit difficult to deal with and I would have liked more in-flight information from the flight deck. Definitely value for money for a direct flight.	1
ATH-LHR A321 new and clean . Sat in row 4A perhaps too far front as the you cant see the TV screen at all due to the fact it is placed on the Business Class Divider (first 3 rows are business class). Flight well priced and I like the fact that their tickets are changable by paying a small fee. The food was fine but portions were too small. Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.	1
MXP-ATH in Economy class. Excellent onboard service and some of the best airline meals. The flight attendants were nice and professionally handled a medical emergency right after landing.	1
I use Air Astana regularly since I have moved to work in Kazakhstan and currently prefer it to the other airlines I have used. I try to arrange my trips back to the UK around the direct flights to LHR. I have never experienced a delayed or cancelled flight the staff are well-trained and generally open and friendly and the food is not exceptional but is of a consistently good quality. I usually travel economy class though on the occasions when I have used business class it has been a good experience.	1
I have been using the services of Air Astana for years. Always a pleasure to travel starting from the convenient way of purchasing the ticket and excellent relation of crew members. I quite often take the domestic flights around two times a month and therefore comfort is crucial for me. In January I travelled to Frankfurt from Astana. As usual right from boarding until landing it was an enjoyable journey.	1
I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.	1
April 27 2013 we took an A330 Airbus from Dublin to Orlando direct. The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs! Also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours. The seat cushions should be replaced with new ones.	1
LHR to Cork return. On time departure from Heathrow and early arrival into Cork. Early Departure from Cork and on stand 20 mins early into Heathrow. Clean cabin each way and efficient (if a bit brusque) cabin crew. Had reasonably priced drinks on the way out only with the bar service prompt and fast. We paid extra for row 1 which was worth every penny. The only downside was oversize bags in the cabin along with perhaps half of the plane breaking the one piece of hand baggage rule leading to no space in the overhead bins. On a par price wise with other competitors on the route (once extras are added in) but overall my preferred choice between London and Cork with good legroom pleasant staff and a reserved seat.	1
JFK-SNN-JFK. Excellent flights in both directions. Cabin crew very professional and attentive. Found the check-in process at JFK terminal 5 with JetBlue staff to be extremely slow. Check-in at Shannon was excellent and very efficient. Clearing USA customs in Shannon saved a lot of time and aggravation that I have experienced coming in from other European countries.	1
JFK to Moscow. Check-in went smoothly. From JFK-SVO the seats were as comfortable as could be. Flight attendants were friendly the food very good: served drinks dinner tea/coffee drinks breakfast tea/coffee. I felt comfortable asking for additional drinks. Inflight entertainment had a very good selection. Once I arrived in Moscow my bags needed to be collected and checked in again. When I came back to the airport 9 hours later I was surprised to find that check-in was easy with no long lines. Once onboard I was surprised to find the airplane in such good condition. There was no inflight entertainment on a 5.5 hour flight but the crew were friendly. The food was my only real disappointment. I'll definitely be flying Aeroflot in the future.	1
Usually I'm flying Economy for business purposes and Business class for leisure. When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight. So my recommendation to use Aeroflot would pretty much depend on the route time and class.	1
CDG TO ATH. Very pleasant flight on time new A320 film with french translation earphone was free. Food hot and excellent. Crew were helpful. Very nice experience.	1
This airline was very helpful during a very difficult time. They did not deliberately increase their prices during the mad panic caused by the bad weather in Europe in the days before Christmas. My original booking to travel London to Athens was with KLM and then I was passed to Air France. Neither of them could organize things properly and after endless problems it took them 4 days to get me only as far as Paris with no hope of leaving for at least a day. Aegean came to my rescue and even though they also took off late they made sure I did not miss my next flight with them to a Greek island. During this 4 day nightmare I had to rebook my domestic flight several times with Aegean and they were very accommodating.	1
IST-ATH-SKG Business. Very good airline clean planes both on time friendly cabin crew. Got a hot meal on the IST-ATH flight but didn´t have time to finish it due to short length of flight stewardess very apologetic. Will definitely fly them again.	1
Flying from Almaty to KL KC935 was very good we had an excellent inflight meal and the staff on the plane were helpful and friendly. The seats were comfortable and the leg room was good. I was able to check in online and then at the airport changed my seat to the emergency exit seats due to the extra leg room with no problems at all. Kuala Lumpur is fantastic and as we head towards George Town we are looking forward to exploring more of Malaysia and of course the return flight with Air Astana.	1
Flight KC907 March 21st and back on KC908 March 26th. I flew with my family from Almaty to Delhi and back and we were all very happy with the flights. The crew was nice and attentive departures were on time and we really enjoyed the time onboard.	1
KC 110 and KC 949 31st January. KC 950 18th February. Air Astana is a very good airline. Staff are friendly and helpful. Because of the demonstrations in Bangkok we had to rebook our flights. Air Astana offered us a free upgrade to Ho Chi Minh City though the ticket was more expensive.	1
I was lucky enough to be on one of Air Astana's new Boeing 767s returning from Bangkok to Almaty on the 12th January 2014. My business class seat was worth paying the extra over economy with the full lay flat seat and lots of room to spread out with a wide side table. Over the time I've been flying Air Astana I have seen them polishing their cabin service and the professionalism and presentation of the staff is of a high standard. Beverage service was very good although the food let the otherwise excellent travel experience down a little the meal was below par for business class. This was in contrast to the trip down to Bangkok and all previous international flights with Air Astana where the food has been very good.	1
AEP to Calafate Calafate to Ushuaia: Ushuaia to AEP. I was surprised at the overall quality of the Aerolineas Argentinas operations : online check-in inflight service from friendly and professional crew and the snacks including the quick Calafate to Ushuaia hop. The radar went down at Ushuaia and AR sent three bus loads of passengers on a four hour bus ride to Rio Grande through a heavy mountain snow. As the buses arrived in Rio Grande the Aerolineas Argentinas flight landed and a completely full flight was airborne for AEP in less than an hour.	1
EZE to Santa Cruz. Everything was fine - no queue to check in flight was on time decent snack on board and aircraft reasonably new. So nothing special but nothing to complain about either.	1
Cancun to Mexico City Business Class. Flight slightly delayed but compensated for by being able to check luggage to onward British Airways flight to London. Crew attentive and professional. Cold lunch very average. Easy to get to Terminal 1 using the air train and despite the information on Mexico City Airport website there were plenty of people with more than just hand luggage - they do check your e-ticket though (didn't need boarding card).	1
DUB-BRU-DUB good service and great value for money on this route. A321 almost 15 years old but clean and comfortable with excellent leather seats and adjustable head-rest. Ground service was competent and speedy and cabin crew were friendly professional and well groomed engaging with passengers. There is a newly updated menu with drinks and snacks available to purchase. I was disappointed to see that there is a now a more limited selection than previous versions of the menu but prices are still keen and quality is very good. All in all vastly superior to Ryanair when flying from Ireland to Belgium.	1
I travelled from Dublin to Boston and Boston to Dublin (23-26 April 2013). I have been positively surprised. Pretty new A330-202 good entertainment good food. The only weak point was the readiness of the staff in Dublin to solve a problem with ESTA Visa. Fortunately I was able to find a helpful person at Aer Lingus at the end.	1
St Petersburg - Moscow. Flight was delayed by more than 30 minutes with no explanations or apologies. Sat on the tarmac for some time. A light snack was served and included drinks. Seat was reasonable comfortable and luggage came quickly enough. Didn't hear any English from the cabin staff. No inflight entertainment but only a short flight.	1
Flew Economy class from JFK to Moscow and then onwards from Moscow to Delhi. The aircraft's are new with rear entertainment in each seat. Food is excellent on the JFK to Moscow flight but down hill from Moscow to Delhi. Service on Aeroflot on all segments is very slow after meal service for food trays to be picked up but good rounds of drinks are provided along side coffee and tea after the meal service.	1
With a business class ticket we got into the admiral club at JFK. Club was neat, comfortable, offered two cocktails and pre-flight snacks including a corn bisque which was quite good. Boarding the plane was quick and soon enough we were airborne. The A332 is roomy but the seats in business were tight and at times a bit uncomfortable. Without an air control, the temp got really sweaty and hot. Sleeping was rough! Food was sufficient but there was no prior cocktail service. Nothing was offered. After asking, the FA was cordial and served us the drinks of choice. Service was professional and exceptionally quick. Flight was safe and upon arriving on route to Rhodes, the lounge in Germany was a great place to get a rest and some complimentary breakfast, the lounge was better than AA's admiral's club at JFK. Dependable but nothing special for a business class service. Would rather fly American Business.	1
LHR-ATH-HER return. The seats were more comfy and planes were clean and tidy. The staff were nice and friendly. The food was extremely nice although you do not get a choice. All this was complimentary.	1
Istanbul to Athens - the best flight with the most courteous flight attendants I have flown in the past 20 years. Keep up the excellent service.	1
LHR-ATH return. Crew very friendly and efficient. Food fine - greek oriented cuisine with complementary drinks. Seats comfortable reasonable legroom. As we had young children check in staff put priority labels on our bags for us. My only minor complaints would be at Heathrow they have just 3 or so desks and only open these a couple of hours or so before departure so you have to queue up to check the bags in - web check in is not that straightforward - I was unable to check us all in together but had to do it as 4 separate check ins. Also unable to purchase a ticket online for my son as he was 1yr old at time of booking but 2yrs old when flying and their website could not handle that. Otherwise a very pleasant start and finish to our holiday.	1
Athens to Santorini. Aegean have a modern fleet of mostly A320s. The flight was short but efficient. Seats comfortable. Business lounge in Athens is small but has a great variety of food.	1
"Not a bad flight but the use of an ageing 757 with seats that looked like they belonged in the 1970s were a disappointment given the trumpeting of their ""new"" business class on their website - I think this is more than disingenuous but Air Astana are hardly alone in this. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lack of business lounge in ALA a major minus. Food average. All in all fair service as it should be noted that this is half the price of BA."	1
"My family of 2 adults and 2 children flew from Astana to Abu Dhabi (non-stop) and back via Almaty. Although it was a New year vacation period with heavy passenger load all services - starting with tickets sales to luggage delivery were efficient and precise. On our way back we flew a brand new Boeing-767 and it was the best plane I have taken so far. We had to stay in Almaty for a night because of the weather conditions and ""Air Astana"" provided us with great rooms in a downtown hotel and round trip transfer. Staff were polite professional and competitive."	1
AEP-FTE via Ushuaia check in chaotic use web check in! New B737-700 nice crew on both legs drinks and food service (cakes cereal bar) nice flight on time arrival. Surprised reading other reviews or lucky. Price for internal flights quite high.	1
DUB to NYC return. A330 found it comfortable and in flight services good. I would comment positively on the check in at Dublin handled quickly and with the US pre-clearance it saved massively on the US side landing in a domestic terminal. On return found the Aer Lingus ground staff in JFK friendly and efficient. Overnight flight to Dublin was quite and comfortable.	1
Flight SXF-SVO-SXF. Very new A320 aircraft with lots of leg room. FA's speak good English are friendly and generally very attentive. For this price I can only recommend Aeroflot on European short distance flights. Be aware though that things are different on long haul.	1
MAD-SVO-MAD; Check in easy both ways. Boarding a little late also on both flights and arrival also late (15 min). During the flights all on 320 aircraft's they are comfortable but nothing special 32'' seat pitch. No IFE for nearly 5 hour travel time. Food decent and good quality. Flight attendants not friendly but polite do their job. They also offer drinks several time during the flight. Recommended for European travel to/from Russia.	1
The new business class is outstanding. Service is top notch, so are the food and drink. The seats are comfortable and have a massage function included. The way they are placed gives you loads of privacy. Way better than Lufthansa, KLM etc.	1
Excellent experience. Good entertainment selection for the long flight, good food for airline food.	1
Check in Cologne was nice and fast and no problem, topbonus number was checked. Boarding was nice and fast, we were welcomed when entering the aircraft. Flight crew informed about flight and cabin crew did a nice job. I got one coffee and a glass of water with a nice muesli bar. You can choose between salty and sweet, all of this is for free. Baggage at Berlin Tegel was fast and we arrived on time. Return flight was the same only the plane was a Bombardier propeler plane, which I like because seating is 2-2 and you can see more. Crew was fine again and this time I choosed salty and got a bag of prezzels. Since this was a small plane, we were bused to gate, but it was fast again. Air Berlin is a good airline and I booked again CGN-TXL-CGN with them.	1
ATH to FRA. Nice clean A320 polite and smiling crew. Service consisted of nice hot dish (unusual these days for short haul) and dessert Just one round of drinks (wine and beers available free of charge) but those who asked were served a second one with a smile. Crew perhaps a bit too tolerant with passengers who did not respect the seat belt sign during taxiing. .	1
Customer support uninterested and never answer emails (despite the fact that I am a Gold card holder). Only contracted lounge in ATH if you are flying extra-Schengen. Unacceptable for the largest carrier in Greece since two of the most popular destinations are extra-Schengen: London and Larnaca. Some of the flight attendants have the nasty habit of ignoring passengers and thereby forgetting to bring drinks or meals to some. Hidden charges - this is not a no- frills airline yet you get charged for booking your flight online (10 EUR) there is no way around this fee as if you buy it over the phone you pay as well if you buy at their ticket desk as well.	1
Athens - Tel Aviv return. The price was fair flight was pleasant staff polite cabin clean the food very average as usual!	1
I travelled with my family on the ALA-BKK flight on Dec 15 2013 and back on the BKK-ALA flight on Jan 4 2014 and both flights were on their brand new 767. The seat comfort was the best I have ever experienced in Economy and the leg room was significantly more spacious than in other economy cabins. Both flights were on time and despite very full flights the service was very efficient and pleasant.	1
EDITORIAL MESSAGE Due to concerns about authenticity of the review submitted and/or the user's name being that of the airline customer as stated on their submit form this comment has been deleted.	1
EZE-COR and back new Austral E-190 with good legroom and interesting IFE. The flight is only an hour long so I wasn't expecting food the snack provided was decent. Used the web check-in so airports were a breeze. The staff and cabin crew was friendly and energetic. However they still have punctuality issues: both my flights were 30 minutes late and screens at the airport showed that many of their flights were delayed too.	1
Flew on the Gatwick/Belfast route 4 times in 2 weeks. Saw today they've increased from 3 to 4 flights a day so I presume they're doing well. They are in direct competition now with FlyBe who used to have this route to themselves and competition can only be a good thing IMHO. AE flight times are very similar to BE although we left before them twice even though their departure time was first. I think that reflects the increased pressure Flybe have on their turnaround times. The service is better on AE even though you still have to pay for food and drink the planes are better (A319s) and were immaculate. Only had hand luggage so can't comment on airport check-in. I did mine using their phone app which worked perfectly. The only niggle is their charging to book seats in the first 5 rows I find it a bit money-grasping. Will definitely continue to use them on this route as long as the price and service continue in the same vein.	1
Flew DUB-LGW-DUB recently and everything went smoothly. Paid extra for front seats Row 3 on way out and row 1 on way back for quick exit and was worth it. Also less hassle and pressure than Ryanair on same route and times. Tickets were only marginally dearer and not enough to make me join the rush for a seat on FR. Flight was on time in both directions even with de-icing procedures. Ground and flight staff were both excellent but sometimes I wish they would enforce the cabin baggage regulations - even a little bit.	1
IST-SVO-PEK return. Pleasantly surprised. 200€ cheaper than everyone else. New clean A330 aircraft with good IFE for long-haul flights. Good food. Language skills and friendliness of staff fair. Last leg back home to IST was with an old IL96. All in all would definitely fly them again.	1
Good checkin, fast boarding. Free magazines during boarding. Free soft drinks and a sandwich. The staff on board were very friendly and attentive. I can recommend Air Berlin.	1
Flew from Stuttgart (STR) to Hamburg (HAM). The online check-in worked without problems and really fast. On the airport you could choose between a few magazines and newspapers you were able to take on the flight (no fee). The flight itself was on time and the staff was very friendly. Even on that short flight (around 50mins) we got offered a drink and a snack (Lindt chocolate or crisps). At leaving the airplane we got Air Berlin chocolate- hearts. The flight back was excellent too. The online check-in worked and the flight was perfectly on time. Very friendly staff and good service again. The flight attendant accidentally spilled a drop of coffee because of turbulence. She gave me two more chocolates as excuse which I found very kind. At all I can say that Air Berlin is a very good airline especially for German and European flights. Also the value for money is very good. I would definitely recommend Air Berlin.	1
I flew non-stop TXL-JFK on 13 March and I was extremely surprised about Air Berlin's new Business Class service. Let's not mention TXL airport though. The rotten airport (including the Air France Business Lounge gates and boarding area) is a disgrace which I will not blame Air Berlin for. However once I boarded the plane the service was so amazing - like in good old times. I got greeted by my name. Blankets slippers amenity kits are individually brought to you with a smile. The new flat seat feels more like a private cabin than a seat - much better than Lufthansa's new Business Class or AA's new one that I used recently too. The food and bar service was like in a restaurant - including a special dish of the day that was not on the menu. Last not least: The flight attendants were tremendously kind and attentive.	1
BRU-ATH-BRU. Both flights very nice new aircraft on time decent food (hot meal) with entertainment and this on a 2.5 hour flight.	1
ATH-IST on a new A320 (there is a possibility of e-check-in or mobile phone check-in). personally I am not using those services. I prefer the traditional check-in line which was convenient and not crowded. The service was nice the crew was friendly but when I asked for a newspaper the flight attendant took a note of my seat; but she never brought me the newspaper (may be they run out of newspapers because they had lot of people in business class). In the returned flight the flight attendant noticed my seat and then she brought the newspaper to me. There was no IFF but on overhead screen you could see the map of the flight and flight information. Food was nice with selection of wine or beer. Both flights on time and about 60% full. On the return flight they had time for duty free trolley.	1
I travelled with Air Astana business class from Kuala Lumpur to Almaty on Sunday October 20th 2013. The whole experience was very enjoyable and comfortable. The cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful and the service was excellent. The food was particularly enjoyable and I was able to relax and enjoy the trip back to Almaty after a hectic week in KL.	1
Travelled to JFK from LGW via DUB return. Went out coach and came back Business. The equivalent BA flight (coach both ways) would have been an extra £600 for the dates I wanted. The other thing was the convenience of using LGW instead of the awful LHR T5. Had a very early and quiet departure from LGW. Boarding was nearly on time and quite smooth. The food on board was appalling. It seems that if you pre- order meals you get far better quality. Maybe that should be made clear on the booking website. I needed to take some medication towards the end of the flight and asked the crew for a glass of water. It was provided in a very flimsy plastic 'glass'. Return leg in Business was on the evening redeye. Check-in was fine. Lounge was ok. Once the flight was called and I went to gate we still had another 30 mins wait. Business class seats had a huge control panel but no documentation on how to operate them. Trial and error eventually got the seat flat. The food was poor for business class. The white wine and fizz were excellent but the Italian red with the steak was disgusting. Breakfast was poor for business class. I would have expected an attempt at a cooked breakfast. But maybe that's why it was so much cheaper than BA.	1
DUB-MCO-DUB. Efficient check-in with added bonus of fast track security in Dublin. Good lounge experience particularly in Dublin. Recaro seats very comfortable. Food quality very good and quality wines served. Staff attentive without being intrusive. A very comfortable way to cross the Atlantic.	1
PEK-SVO-BCN-SVO-PEK in Business class. PEK-SVO and SVO-PEK flights on A330-200 and A330-300. SVO- BCN-SVO on A321. Staff spoke good English food was tasty and served with good china. Amenity bags given out on all legs including European flights. Drinks are good. A330 seats are not full flat but managed to sleep on both legs. A321 seats are real business class seats not economy seat with empty middle seats. AVOD pretty good plenty in English. Business lounge at SVO Terminal F is new but Terminal E is in pretty old - could not find a seat. Lounge food and drink limited. Transit at SVO was not as bas as expected. Issuing business lounge at transit desk can be pain as you need this access card to get into lounge but you can only get the access card through transit desk. No priority boarding on all legs. I will definitely fly Aeroflot again if they keep the standard.	1
Munich-Tokyo - pleasantly surprised. Plane from Moscow to Tokyo was brand new. Very good and extensive entertainment program with many choices. Tickets were cheap. Stewardess was nice and the food was good. The big downside however is Moscow Airport. Other shops close early and the prices are very expensive the staff seems a bit careless. Just doesn't manage to keep up with bigger airports.	1
Self Check-in is easy for use but unfortunately not cover most abroad airport (e.g. CDG France). Manual Check-in is a little slow. Meal is very good even for economy class. The staff attitude and friendliness is impressive. And the flight is very comfortable.	1
ATH-LHR on A321 was great with nice inflight entertainment. Food average and crew professional.	1
I take Air Astana flights on regular basis local and international economy and business. There are a lot of modern new air planes that are being added continuously to Air Astana. The service is much more pleasant and more active inside the plane because the crew are very young comparing to KLM British Airways Lufthansa. The food is comparatively much better than other international airlines. In some planes they have some seats that are very unusual but comfortable you can sleep on them very easy and comfortable. On the international flight prices they are very reasonable. I'm definitely recommending use Air Astana.	1
13 Oct 2013 KC887 Business Class. Almaty - Beijing. Thoroughly professional service good food! Great entertainment on iPad excellent on board staff simple check in procedure. Lacks lounge in Almaty.	1
AKL-SYD one way. I booked this flight with pretty low expectations. The flight was 90 minutes late. However this flight was better than expected. A340s used on this route are old. However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper. I think it would be less comfortable to fly the much longer AKL-EZE sector on this airline but for AKL-SYD they were fine.	1
MAD to BUE and back in economy class. B747-400 used were really old no personal screens in the seatbacks only small ceiling screens. Furthermore on MAD-BUE flight the inflight entertainment system gave up working shortly after the safety movie so no movie or Airshow at all. Meal/drink service was absolutely minimal no drinks at all during both 12h night flights. Cabin announcements unmotivated and in bad English. The old fashioned seats were very comfortable. great legrooom and recline. Bring your own food drinks and entertainment don't expect anything special from the cabin crew but enjoy the comfy seats which are much better than those ultra-thin seats which most leading carriers offer today.	1
Flew on the new service from London Gatwick to Belfast City airport and was very impressed with the service. Great price lovely comfortable planes on time and very efficient boarding (probably helped that the plane was only 2/3rd full). Only drawback although not necessarily the airlines fault is the horrible small dingy and dirty departure gate they use at Gatwick South terminal.	1
Cork to Malaga and satisfied with all aspects of the flight. On time comfortable pleasant crew good food and excellent value for money. I usually fly Ryanair from Shannon - who possess none of the above qualities - except blowing trumpets on arrival. For me to use Aer Lingus to travel to Spain means an extra 60 mile road trip which I am happy to take.	1
HKG-SVO-HKG A330 Economy. Both legs slightly delayed planes reasonably well kept and seats are comfortable with average pitch and recline. Limited choice of movies and TVs on the seat back AVOD IFE. Food was ok. 2 meals but no mid-flight snack for the 10hr flight. Plenty of water runs. Crew pleasant enough.	1
Flew over the Easter holidays from Cologne to Berlin. Flight was rebooked to an early morning flight which was not as planed. Checked in online with no problem. Staff was nice and as soon we were airborne service began. The cabin had a nice smell of fresh coffee and fresh baked roll for breakfast. Soon I was served a cup of hot coffee one glass of apple juice and a hot saltbread roll. All was tasty and the crew was very nice on a one hour flight. Cockpit informed about flight. Baggage took some while because Tegel Airport is way to small but this is not Air Berlins fault. Better than Germanwings since service is free of charge.	1
We travelled from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL earlier this month. We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.	1
Bangkok - Astana Astana - Almaty Almaty - Istanbul. I have been flying Air Astana regularly for nearly 10 years. I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited. Cabin crew spoke quite good English - even on the internal sectors. Seats and legroom quite comfortable though the seats do not go horizontal on the long sectors. They provide good to reasonable value for money.	1
ASU-AEP morning flight on time clean and professional. Not many flights between Paraguay and Argentina and this one went into the city airport Aeroparque saving a lot of time.	1
I flew from Venice to Dublin on 24 Feb 2013. There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.	1
Recently flew Cork - Lanzarote return. Both flights were on time and the service was excellent. Cabin crew very good particularly on return flight. Cabins were clean and tidy and Aer Lingus seems to have tightened up on the practice of allowing oversize baggage into the cabin. I had booked well in advance so price was quite reasonable. My usual gripe is with Cork Airport arrivals where the air bridges remain redundant and passengers have to brave the elements and 3 flights of stairs to get inside the airport building.	1
SVO-PVG. 767-300ER 45 mins delayed departure and arrival twice. Seating was ok personnel somewhat friendly only small central screen with Russian movie as inflight entertainment good food with drink rounds no rounds in between. Old style experience. Good price.	1
TLV-SVO-PEK return. TLV-SVO on time excellent ground service quick check-in. Aircraft a little bit old but well kept no entertainment but very nice and good service. SVO-PEK on time good transit arrangements A330-300 - new aircraft good service and meals. PEK- SVO on time B767 - again good service and meals. SVO-TLV - a long walk from arrival terminal to departure terminal very comfortable waiting area A330-300 - brand new aircraft good entertainment and very good crew service.	1
DUS-TXL-DUS. Attitude of AB ground-staff in DUS remains problematic. They are grumpy and arrogant. Crew on board okay. Very punctual and swift performance. Price (396 euro RTN for 4) included snack drink chocolate and 23 kg luggage. The only problem with AB is reliability. They cancelled the last two flights out of Berlin so we had to leave almost three hours earlier. Had a similar experience last year. On the other hand: definitely preferred AB above Germanwings because of constant strike risk.	1
Flight LED-ALA. The new aircraft in rather good condition although seats are very used in economy class. Sensible costs good service on board friendly crew and tasty meal. The traveler mini-bag was given consisted of toothbrush toothpaste a bandage for sleeping and a pair of socks. On-board entertainment was rather good also pillows for more comfort were provided by default. These airlines will be my choice for future trips to KZ.	1
Round trip HKG-ALA-SVO. Meals tasted good. Staff Service excellent both inside and outside the flight. Staff in transfer lounge nice and helpful. Before my return trip from SVO-HKG I had a flight from Riga to SVO with Aeroflot. When I arrived at ALA for transfer the staff of Air Astana suspected and asked if I had any checked luggage. I said I had and Aeroflot had already transferred it to Air Astana as they told me so. He said my luggage was not with the flight according to their record. He also went out to see if my luggage was at claim lounge. He couldn't find mine so took me to report lost baggage. 15 mins after reporting the loss I was waiting for my next flight in departure lounge. My luggage was found at SVO airport. Staff in transfer lounge were professional and helpful.	1
BUE to MVD so very short flight. Excellent service very friendly staff. Even got a snack in a handy plastic bag to reuse at security next time - nice idea. On return from Montevideo arrived to check in and was offered a seat on a flight leaving one hour earlier. So great experience. Only negative was very complicated booking process. Booked online but then had to call the office here in France to make payment. Not possible either online or through Buenos Aires call centre. Very strange.	1
Business class #124 Chicago to Dublin very clean and new-feeling Airbus 330-300 fine staff very thoughtful and professional. The seat is very comfortable Recarro sport-type does not go fully flat but is very nice in all other conformations. Even though Aer Lingus doesn't match up with the fabulous seating/bedding of major liners they exceed the US carriers in other ways. We saved about $1500 versus those carriers and I felt it was a fine bargain. I'd fly them again for sure.	1
I flew from Berlin Schönefeld (SXF) to Dublin (DUB). The flight lasted only 2 hours. The cabin was ok it was clean. The seat comfort was ok but not excellent. The staff service was excellent. The food was ok and the sky shop had a great selection. The inflight entertainment was ok but a bit boring.	1
SVO-DEL A330. First time with Aeroflot was a pleasant surprise. No trouble at all and a very professional service. Vegetarian meal had been ordered and was delivered without having to ask for it. On one leg the food was a disaster but on the return flight it was really good. Nice selection of games music and movies. Transfer at SVO very smooth nice connected terminals. Our cabin baggage was never measured even though its size was obviously very close to the limit.	1
Good value for money. New Airbus from Moscow to Tokyo food above average and entertainment system quite satisfying. Aeroflot has very strict rules when it comes to the baggage weight and size limits so try to have that in mind when travelling. They measure your bags and they will charge for every additional kilo or cm.	1
After reading quite a number of negative reviews I can not believe I actually flew Air Berlin. My flight from Zurich-Dusseldorf-Miami return in Business class was one of the most pleasurable flying experiences I have had. The planes were clean. The crews were efficient and kind. The food was plentiful and incredibly good. The seats are extremely comfortable. The entertainment is the best in the air. Overall Air Berlin is much better than KLM Air France British etc.	1
ZRH-DUS-JFK-BER-FRA with Air Berlin. On time flights with very friendly check in staff and cabin crew. I will use this company again.	1
Fly Air Astana once a week on average internal KZ and international. Consistent friendly service and generally very punctual. Last flight Almaty to Atyrau business class. Boarding always a mess but once on board great service. Occasionally poor attention to regulations with people on mobile phones while taking off and landing but generally getting better.	1
Buenos Aires to Bariloche return and found both the airplane comfortable and the crew very attentive. The snack and beverage services were nice too. There was a delay in the departure from Bariloche to Buenos Aires which seems to be usual in Aerolineas Argentinas. It is said that many passengers choose some other airlines instead of Aerolineas because of the habitual delays. I hope it will become more efficient and competitive in time.	1
SYD-AKL return. Staff pleasant and polite. Food edible if you are hungry. A good budget airline seats in good condition and comfortable. Only downside would be no in flight entertainment. It wouldn't kill them to put on a movie especially during school holidays.	1
Boston to Dublin onboard an Airbus 330. A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.	1
Oslo-Moscow economy. New A320 fine leg space attentive cabin crew with decent English skills light meal. Moscow-Bangkok economy. New A330 excellent leg space good cabin crew fine meals individual screens with decent selection of movies. On the return from Hong Kong to Moscow the B767 was visibly old and needed refurbishment it lacked individual entertainment systems.	1
NUE-DUS-CUR Return. Dash 8/A330-200. Air Berlin has a good product in Economy Class. Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality. Note that AB is a semi-LCC though with mostly regular fares. This could explain the poor Food and Beverage service. Flights were all remarkably on time.	1
Short haul internal flight from Berlin to Munich and return - 27th Dec. Have flown with this carrier on a number of occasions in recent times on both short and long haul flights. Have found them to provide a very good level of service on all occasions. This flight was short duration with no in flight entertainment and provision of only a light refreshment. Seats satisfactory for short haul only and legroom tight in comparison to long haul aircraft. Unable to be seated together despite early booking for group of 6. However given the short flight any inconveniences were minor - no complaints. Long haul evaluation just below level of Etihad/Emirates/V Aust. Have used and will happily continue to use and recommend this carrier.	1
ALA-KZO. return. Service was pleasant and efficient. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Food was good but could have been a little better.	1
Astana to Frankfurt and back in May 2013. We flew with a large group of small children. Airport staff were helpful with check-in and we were allowed to board first. Cabin staff were very helpful and friendly and dealt well with our kids (handed out children's packs on the way out for example.) Food was good quality and there were films showing throughout the plane (no individual at-seat screens in economy though). A pleasant experience overall!	1
Buenos Aires to Calafate economy class. Food and drinks were reasonable. Cabin interior was clean. On return the aircraft was MD80 legroom reasonable but as no entertainment service on this 3 hour flight.	1
We flew to and from Madrid and we left and arrived on time. Both trips take about 11 hours and the experience was good. The seat is confortable though it is not a flat bed and the food was good. The plane was a rather old B747.	1
Sydney to Auckland. No inflight entertainment just a snack and drinks service and good legroom which Aerolineas have on the A340. Friendly and engaging crew. Overall a good flight and very cheap ticket.	1
Buenos Aires to Sydney via Auckland. Staff were efficient and friendly enough. The food was fine leg room pretty good. Buenos Aires to Auckland after dinner the lights go off and you do not see the staff often after that but water was left out on the tray. TVs only in the centre aisle but audio was in English. Blankets and pillows on the seat. The plane had been around for years though. A negative is at the boarding lounge gate you handheld baggage is searched and they took all my wife's makeup and threw it away they should have provided plastic bags because it needed to be in an individual bag and she was very upset about this.	1
Flight was cancelled recently from Shannon to Manchester 25.1.13. However Aer Lingus took the strain they organised overnight stay in a hotel and booked us onto the next flight the next day. Staff were excellent and could have not done more for us in a difficult situation.	1
Dublin - Lanzarote 20 Dec return 03 Jan. I have travelled a lot with Aer Lingus and it seems they have moved away from the very low cost type of airline back to what they were. Was seated in row 2D adequate space (I'm 6ft 1). Crew very good as always and its nice to see the mature crew menders on board. I do have one gripe - Aer Lingus have a fantastic Deli/Pay Menu its a pity they never have any of the stock this is my 8th time since July with Aer Lingus where the stocks run out by the time the trolley hits row 2. I complained to the senior cabin crew member - she said agreed - that its always happening to them. Would still use them again no problem.	1
TXL-AUH return. My second long haul flight with Air-Berlin and as before can't understand the bad comments on this forum. No worse or better than most other European airlines. A330 aircraft on both legs. Flights bang on time great IFE with lots of choices good quality screen and an OK price. Seat is also as comfortable (or non- comfortable) as on other European airlines such as Lufthansa and KLM. On the negative side: both Berlin Tegel and Abu-Dhabi airports are horrible - both outdated too small and boarding was a nightmare on both. That is not an Air-Berlin problem or fault. What is however Air Berlin's fault is the stupidity in the way we boarded in Tegel buses taking us to the aircraft and passengers boarding an A330 from both the front and rear gates without taking into account seat numbers. Result was dozens of people trying to go past each other in opposite directions in the middle of the aircraft - the most brainless way to board such a large aircraft that I have ever experienced. Other than that nothing to shout or not shout about and will use them again.	1
Berlin - Madeira - Berlin. Very friendly crew on both flights including regular updates on flight status. Compared to Germanwings all passengers still get free drinks (2 rounds alcoholic beverages are not included) a rather tasty sandwich and then some chocolate later. Space is also ok. So while the service has declined over the years (no more free magazines) Air Berlin still offers better service than most other charter carriers plus the friendly staff made both flights very enjoyable. The only thing I would criticise is that although they show even a movie on this flight you need to purchase headsets which in the end nobody did (yes they are only 3 Euro but giving those out for free would be nice).	1
7 hour flight from Almaty to Bangkok this month and it was very comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies. Overall it was a very pleasant flight and I would definitely choose to fly with Air Astana again.	1
Dushanbe - Almaty in business class. A Western standard experience including attentive and friendly cabin crew and excellent food. On time departure and arrival. This short trip was a relaxing moment in a busy day plus got some work done in the spacious seat. The seat armrest was broken though so hopefully a repair was due just after this flight.	1
I frequently fly with Air Astana mostly within Kazakhstan and sometimes abroad. Air Astana is the best airline in Kazakhstan in terms of comfort and service. Luckily I have not had major delays and those which I had were usually weather related. Flight attendants were friendly and professional good aircraft's better legroom choice of food and entertainment helpful customer service. Overall very good progress in the last 5-7 years and dramatically improved flying experience if compared with its predecessor airlines just around 10 years ago.	1
Almaty to Hong Kong and back. It was smooth no delays. 757 of Air Astana’s fleet has good business class with quite comfortable seats - almost flat. Good food and service. Inflight entertainment is ok they provide Ipads which is quite convenient.	1
Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.	1
Unexpectedly excellent. Did exactly what was required (LHR-ORK-LHR) affordable smilingly and on time. Can't ask for more than that these days.	1
Flying from a regional airport in Germany to Dublin at Christmas time over the past few years I have usually tended to use Lufthansa usually transiting via Frankfurt. However in 2012 I chose instead to connect via London Gatwick on the outbound and London Heathrow on the inbound UK parts of the journey. Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey. T2 at Dublin was impressive and although there was a mishap with my luggage on arrival the matter was sorted efficiently and to my satisfaction. I will be using Aer Lingus again in a few months time and looking forward to it.	1
Flew JFK to Dublin on December 26 2012. Check in was fast boarding was smooth and the flight was pleasant to Dublin. Flew back January 6 2013 Dublin to JFK. Check in immigration and customs pre- clearance boarding were all smooth. The only issue and this is most likely not an Aer Lingus issue was the ridiculous walk from the plane to pick up baggage. Perhaps this was due to ongoing construction at the terminal. If not I feel for anyone that has trouble walking.	1
Beijing Capital International to London Heathrow via Moscow. The staff were great. The seats were of average comfort for economy and the inflight entertainment was great with a choice of films and games. The only drawback to this flight is the lack of alcohol (and the choice of drinks is indeed rather limited). However that was the only issue I found and it wasn't too much of a problem. Also navigating my way from the old terminal to my next flight was fine too.	1
Paid a low price for flight Paris-Tokyo (with a stopover at Moscow). First leg Paris-Moscow was very good. A new airbus with comfortable seats helpful and smiling staff full bar service and good food. No flight entertainment. Transfer at SVO was ok. Moscow-Tokyo was not delayed. While food and onboard staff were nice the plane a Boeing 767 was falling apart. Flight entertainment was a Russian dubbed copy of Home Alone in one of the few screens that would pop out here and there. The second leg was a brand new A330 with new seats individual screens more than 50 films to choose from full bar service and great food. Staff were friendly and English speaking. Great value for money and I strongly recommend it.	1
Flew an A330-200 from JFK to DUS in economy. The flight was about 25 minutes late taking off (good by most standards). Food was average service was average although the staff came across as a bit unfriendly. The inflight entertainment system was excellent (there were a wide range of up-to-date shows movies and music to select from). However the seats were the most uncomfortable I've ever flew in. My knees were literally pressed up against the seat ahead of me the entire flight. No legroom whatsoever. On the whole nothing to shout about but not the worst either.	1
Flew from Almaty to Istanbul and was greeted by friendly helpful staff on both the outward and inward journeys. I am a tall person and I asked at check in for a seat with lots of leg room and was asked if I wanted to sit by the emergency exit. As a consequence my journeys were wonderful lots of leg room and helpful staff.	1
KC902- flight from London to Astana. No delay at all. The seat was quite comfortable staff service excellent I was served some traditional Kazakhstan food and it was delicious. There wasn't much inflight entertainment. This airline is the best way to access Kazakhstan.	1
Almaty to Bangkok return. Everything ran on time (slightly ahead of time actually) and service was up to the usual AA high standards. I was offered a free upgrade to Business Class on the return (overnight) trip which was very much appreciated - I slept solidly throughout the journey and felt surprisingly fresh on arrival.	1
Dublin to London. I am a frequent global business traveller and was very impressed. Especially impressed with the friendliness of the cabin crew who were professional and helpful! Will definitely travel with them again.	1
LHR-SNN return over the New Year period. Two excellent flights both leaving and arriving early. Ok they have 'add-ons' at the time of booking but they are transparent about it and the luggage allowance is generous. In my view they are the best airline to travel on to/from Ireland. Have been travelling with them for over 25 years and they have been consistently good.	1
Flew JFK to DUB return in J for the holidays. Check in at JFK is quick and easy and the oasis lounge is comfortable well stocked and quiet. What sets Aer Lingus apart is the friendly crew and to warm genuine Irish welcome on boarding . Although it was a full overnight flight the crew provided excellent service with generous drinks top ups and above average J food. The almost flat bed is reasonably comfortable for the length of flight. I only managed an hours sleep as its a short hop over the pond. Nice continental breakfast towels and proper tea before landing. Bags off first and overall excellent value. Return leg on the 105 on New Years Eve was excellent. Friendly J check in with no wait new T2 lounge quiet and the benefits of pre-flight clearance in Dublin are immeasurable. Again great crew generous drinks good food and warm smiles.	1
"LED-SVO and KZN-SVO-LED. All flights on A320 and A321 aircraft. Extremely comfortable seating onboard all flights. Cabin and flight deck crews seemed to have excellent English skills although all 3 flights were domestic Russian ones. Aircraft clean transfer at SVO extremely easy in a new facility. On each flight served a ""lunch box"" style snack with a croissant or sandwich and a carton of apple juice in addition to a full bar service. Punctual flights and quick baggage reclaim. I am a member of KLM's Flying Blue frequent flyer programme and the miles for these flights were added quickly within a few days of travel. Only issue was that the first flight had been rescheduled and only a telephone call to Aeroflot in Moscow could confirm this - they did not try to contact me first."	1
BCN-Moscow-Shanghai return. You really get what you pay for. The transfer at Sheremetyevo is not the most pleasant - old-fashioned counters rude staff with poor English skills. Onboard everything gets better - seat width and food is not that bad but you better bring music and books with you as entertainment is zero. Return flight much better on the newest Airbus A330 a long 10 hours flight. Luggage arrived intact. Altogether a great choice if you are on a budget.	1
Flew an A330 from Berlin to Miami - I enjoyed the food I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough leg room. It was a little tight when the person in front reclined all the way. The entertainment was the best system I have seen lots of movies TV games and the map including flight data.	1
ALA-BKK on 13th February 2013 returning on 17th February 2013. Offered a business class upgrade on boarding. The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry. The service was great and the drinks trolley was always in service.	1
Return flight from KL to ALA was in complete contrast to the previous flight down. On time crew very friendly and professional. Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight. However suffice to say that the experience on the return journey was a good one with very good service and perfectly on time with the plane unloading from an air bridge on arrival making unloading of the 767 much more efficient.	1
Flew DUB-JFK-DUB in Business on A330. Both flights were excellent with attentive staff good food and top- ups of drinks whenever you wanted. Staff did not disappear into galleys during either daytime or night time legs. IFE is very good with a good choice of up to date movies. There was a problem with this on the return and they only managed to get the outbound movies shown. The lie-almost-flat seat was very comfortable and enabled me to sleep for a couple of hours. Both legs were on time.	1
JFK to Moscow to VVO. New Airbus planes in good condition. Efficient staff and interesting hot meals. All flights on time. Baggage handling in Moscow and Vladivostok was incredibly fast. Very satisfied.	1
Brussels-Moscow-Tokyo return on A320 and Boeing 767-300ER. A very decent choice if you are on a budget the negative aspects of the travel being related to the airport. The crew did not smile much with poor English skills. Drinks and food came often on SVO-NRT. IFE is very poor on the 767-300.	1
"JFK-DUS DUS-ZRH TXL-MUC MUC-DUS DUS-JFK. From reading all these reviews before my trip I was a bit nervous but actually my trip turned out awesome! I took five Air Berlin flights on my 3 week vacation and not one of them was an issue. Even my bag arrived with me! All flights were on time served pretty decent food and the flight attendants were friendly. We got served chicken or pasta on the long haul flight and croissants or chips on the short haul. The legroom especially on the A330-200 was tight even for a 5' 3"" person like me but it was a manageable. If you're tall you might have a problem. Each seat on the A330 is equipped with a personal inflight entertainment with a good selection of games and movies. When you select a seat on the A330 choose an even number because you'll have a full window instead of sitting between two halves of one. My only problem was the boarding process. Too many people were pushing and shoving when their group is called and the airline changed a gate in MUC without notifying us. Overall my experience was good much better than an US airline. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again!"	1
KC907/8 DEL-ALA-DEL on Y class. The Flex fare reasonably priced. Check in both at DEL and ALA was good. Minimal waiting times and the staff were very professional. Board process was ok. Slightly let down by the fact that we were bussed to aircraft and made to board via steps in the rain. Both flights were on well kept clean A320s. Flights were relatively empty so I had 3 seats to myself. Cabin Crew were pleasant and professional. Food and Drink was tasty well presented appropriate for route and time of day. IFE from drop down screens were a bit of a disappointment and hard to follow. Better off bringing a book. Punctual departure and arrival. Would fly again and recommend to others.	1
ALA-TSB - Emb 190 Business. Early morning business flight. All on time and aircraft full on this relatively new route. Crew were friendly and breakfast was very nice. Departure formalities from Almaty are confusing and bizarre with no priority for business class at any stage apart from check in. No Air Astana staff to guide you through the complexities rather there are hawkers trying to make some cash who are more of a hindrance. Lounge is horrid not even 2* let alone 4*. No priority boarding for business class. Hand held TV offered but I didn't use it. Would happily fly Air Astana again.	1
TSE-CIT-ALA. A couple of internal Kazak flights. All on time. Clean and comfortable. Leg room good on both flights. Crews fine but seemed to be little interest in standard health and safety (eg phones ringing in flight people walking around the aircraft during taxi). Did a good job but not a 4* airline!	1
22nd November Dublin to Orlando. Business Class. Excellent service and cabin crew. Timekeeping excellent. Hope return flight on 19th January is as good!	1
Flew ORK-FAO with them. Great service and flight time even if it is a bit early at 6.40am. Food is excellent and not too expensive. Cabin crew are professional and friendly. Aircraft Airbus A320 was 5 years old and was very clean and tidy. Fare was good 120 euro return cheaper by 30 than Ryanair however they are far superior to fly with and are very lenient with bag weight. Pity they do not fly more services into Shannon like SNN- MUN SNN-BCN and SNN-AMS. these would do very well for business and leisure people.	1
LHR-Cork in Nov. Checked in online very easily. Flight was quick to board cabin crew were friendly and the seats were comfy. Cork-LHR was delayed 1.5 hours due to poor weather conditions at LHR we were updated frequently by EI staff. Once the a/c arrived they were very quick to board us and again the service was brilliant.	1
Helsinki-SVO-Havana. The flight went surprisingly well the plane was new lots of entertainment options even a USB port below the screen. The staff were not smiling just like at Moscow airport. The flight was on time and 40% cheaper than others doing the same route.	1
London Heathrow-Tokyo via Moscow with A320 and B767 even though being informed that Moscow-Tokyo would be the latest A330. The meals throughout the flights were good with all hot meals. No entertainment (even music) available on A320. No individual monitor available on B767. Seat and cabin interior definitely need refurbishment. Even though seat on B767 was very tired it had deeper reclining and was softer than some of other airlines. The cabin crews were friendly. Will fly with them again.	1
Flew from Dusseldorf to JFK. A330 service in Business class. I often fly BA Virgin and Singapore Airlines transatlantic. I have to say I thought Air Berlin were just as good (admittedly SIA use A380's on the JFK- Frankfurt run and are a little roomier). I thought the seat was very good (I was in 2A). The food was good and the entertainment system was good although I think Virgin wins that one. Flight was on time despite a big headwind. I will definitely fly them again and love the fact I can avoid Heathrow and use my Avios points.	1
Service was good provide travel kits headsets entertainment programs excellent but during boarding I was frustrated by rude attitude of flight attendants one flight attendant gave us instructions about emergency exits we set in front and two other crew came to me and asked me if I was instructed or not about emergency exit because I had small bag in my hands. She raised her voice was very aggressive didn't ask me but said firmly that I must change my seat. Then went away to business class returned with flight attendant-supervisor who said it was ok for me to keep my bag in my hands and was very sorry about this situation. I think the crew need more training (working with passengers and working in a team).	1
Moscow-Almaty-Bangkok. Both flights departed on time. Flight attendants helpful and friendly with reasonable English. Food was good and sufficient. IFE's a bit restricted and out of date for Business Class. Big problems in Almaty because I could not produce the credit card used for the booking. Took several hours of work and an email from a bank in Australia before I was allowed to board the flight. Flight full from Moscow to Almaty and only a third full from Almaty to Bangkok. Despite the problems with credit cards I will still fly them.	1
KUL-ALA-AKX return. First flight from KUL-ALA on their 767-300 flight was on time and service was great. But for a 7 hour flight it was quite hot in the cabin. Had some trouble with my visa-on-arrival in Almaty but the ground crew were very helpful translating throughout the immigration process: they even carried my bags and checked them in for my connecting flight while I was waiting for my visa. Flights from ALA-AKX and return were good got on their new Embraer and the service onboard was excellent though the crew does need improvements their English. Overall it was a great experience and would like to fly them again.	1
Roundtrip MCO-DUB-MCO. November 10-17 2012. A330-200 was clean the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment system was excellent the food acceptable and the cabin crew attentive. We paid the extra $100US round-trip per person for bulkhead/emergency row seating. It was well worth it. Row 11 A/C has excellent legroom. A draw back is that the entertainment monitor is between the seat and has to fold up as there is no seat in front of you. I would recommend Aer Lingus in the future.	1
Madrid-Moscow-Shanghai. Madrid-Moscow flight new and spacious A321 no inflight entertainment food ok but drinks only served before the meal and not with the meal. Good connection in Moscow. Moscow-Shanghai on Airbus 330-200 good inflight entertainment best row is 24 with more leg space. The seats on the side are more expensive but the ones in the middle are free of charge. Same problem with drinks here. Return flights the same I would recommend - good value for money.	1
Return flight London Heathrow to Moscow Sheremetyevo. The outward flight started off good. We left on time and the plane was new and comfortable. The food is of a good standard. However once we landed at Sheremetyevo it was a whole other story. Due to weather we had to wait just yards away from our gate because there was ice on the ground. The plane was very stuffy and I think it took an extra half an hour until we finally stopped at our taxi gate. On the inward flight it was much better. Very quick and comfortable.	1
CPT-GBE GBE-JNB. First flight a clean Bae146 in very good condition half empty with loads of leg room. Food excellent for an airline and service find. Second flight on an equally clean ATR72 with equally good snacks. All flights on time. Much prefer them to SAX or Airlink!	1
Return from Faro to Dusseldorf. Check-in in Faro was quick even with only 2 check in counters open. Got seats in back of the plane. Check-in staff nice. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off on time. Service on board was great very nice crew. Got one coffee one water and one nice beer for some change. Free movie shown on overhead screens and again a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information like seeing Paris at night from the sky. We stopped on the tarmac so deplaning was via bus to terminal which took about 45 minutes due to bus queue on terminal. Baggage took about 1 hour before on the belt. With out that mishap Air Berlin is a great airline.	1
Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.	1
Excellent recent flights great selection from inflight service. Very friendly attentive and polite staff. Flights were on time and very comfortable good connections modern aircraft and all in all a great flying experience.	1
Four flights IST-ALA-TSE-ALA-KUL. All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs. Good seat comfort (cradle seats on shorter sectors angled lie flat on B767 to KUL). The only disappointment was the lounge in ALA which is basically a bar and you get a voucher for a soft drink plus a snack.	1
Business class to Beijing return from Almaty. Service was good and staff friendly. Better food better wines even cold champagne now. Staff are the airlines asset. They are informative polite and helpful.	1
Cardiff to Dublin evening 11th November. ATR72 looked relatively new bright interior due to LED lights. Seating very cramped more than other ATR 72's I have flown bearable for one hour. The first and second rows have facing seats which were occupied by 2 drunk women. They managed to buy a round of drinks from the drinks trolley and continue their celebrations. The landing was smooth and on time we turned off the runway quickly to reach the stand. Whilst waiting to disembark one of women wore the pilot's jacket as her friend took photographs All the action should be captured on the plane's CCTV. Certainly a different form of in flight entertainment!	1
Milan - Dublin - New York and back. All the flights were on time at departures and arrived at destination before scheduled. The crew were professional and friendly and the flights uneventful. The A320 have very comfortable seats economy A330 is a bit short of space for long haul flights but inflight entertainment and the service were ok considering the low fare paid.	1
JFK-SVO-CDG and SVO-JFK. A330 New York-Moscow excellent new and seats were good (2x4x2). Travelling with my wife it was convenient to have the seats to ourselves without someone else next to us. A320 Paris-Moscow just okay nothing extraordinary but not bad (3x3 seating LCD screens in the row). Personal IFE with good selection of movies in Russian and English on JFK-SVO. They served a hot meal with alcoholic beverages plus usual assortment of soft drinks even on flight Moscow to Paris. As someone who'd flown Aeroflot over the past 20 years they have changed for the better over the last couple of years - and are by far the cheapest option to fly from NY to Moscow.	1
"Peking-Munich in Business. A good experience. New A330/A 319 planes clean and good seats. New lie-flat seat on 330 wasn't really flat but perfectly fine for a daytime flight. The real surprise was the 319 which has ""proper"" business class seats even on this short three-hour flight (i.e. four seats in a row rather than the usual six seats with the middle seat kept free). Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport. Yes the terminal building has been refurbished to international standards but the many uniformed people barking at you in Russian and the organisational chaos are still a nuisance. No customer service culture there. I chose Aeroflot on price and got very good value for money."	1
Fantastic Service. Booked from Australia for Jo'burg to Maun flight. Kept great communications for any changes and even transferred me on a SA flight no extra charge for my Kasane-Jo'burg leg when I explained about connection time with my Qantas flight due to schedule changes without having to be asked and emailed me back a new booking. Great service nice snack on a short leg clean modern plane on time friendly ground staff. I hear things might have been different a few years back but certainly my experience was very good and would fly with them again.	1
Francistown - Johannesburg 16 September. Good short flight efficiently run with good crew. On time and no problems.	1
In August Johannesburg to Maun and Kisane to Johannesburg. Both flights were spot on time. Service on board was fine with drinks and light snacks served for the roughly 2 hour flight in each direction. Aircraft's were in good shape and the seats comfortable for this type of trip. Check-in in Jo'burg was easy and very quick. Check- in in Kisane was a breeze as the airport is tiny. All in a good experience and a great way to enhance your Botswana experience.	1
Flew Dusseldorf to Faro Portugal. Check-in in Dusseldorf was really nice got seats in row 9 with window. Check-in staff nice and polite and helpful. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off just 10 minutes late due to emergency landing of a 4U plane. Service on board was great very nice crew. Service with the Sansibar-Snack was nice we got a Currywurst with roll and two nice bottle of Pommery champagne for a little extra but it was nice to have that. Free movie shown on overhead screens and a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information. We got jetbridge at Faro so deplaning was nice and smooth again. Baggage was on time on the belt. So this is a great airline.	1
Flew from Muenster Osnabrueck to Corfu 2nd August and returned 6th September 2014. As we had our dog and dog box we found the service by Air Berlin staff at both airports very helpful and my family are grateful for this service. We travel every year to Corfu for a long summer holiday and certainly shall use Air Berlin again.	1
Amsterdam to Atyrau return. Using Air Astana many times (not just this route) I have found the flights to be very expensive and often delayed due to technical issues or weather plus chaotic check-in staff! However the flight itself is well above average in food flight entertainment and service. Taking into account the experience from arriving at the airports plus the cost of the flight one would expect a smooth journey per se. Unfortunately this is not the case! Being a state airline and promoted as such there is a lot of room for improvement in this area.	1
Almaty-Astana return and Almaty-Abu Dhabi and all flights were fine. Check-in cabin service average food basic no delays. The Abu Dhabi flight was in an A320 though so entertainment and facilities were limited. It's like a lesser western airline but they do seem well-organised and have a good website. The only problem I had was caused by Etihad. I booked a codeshare through the Etihad website as it was the same price but included a bus to Dubai. However the bus departure time on my ticket did not exist and had never existed. I had to wait 3 hrs for a bus. If they had provided accurate information I would have made alternate arrangements.	1
Almaty to London. The service was pleasant and efficient KCTV was handed out as soon as seat belt signs went out so the time waiting for drinks to be served passed quickly by. As for the new wine selection this is good now that imported wines are included. The change from my first flight (Nov 2007) to now is positive.	1
GUW-TSE-SVO. I flew for business in Economy class and was impressed how professional the service was. The food is ok there was IFE via a small flip-down video screen and headsets were handed out to all passengers in time. During the flight from TSE to SVO they issued a travel pack (flight socks blindfold comb). I did have a complaint with the customer service from one member of the cabin crew and requested a comment form which was handled professionally by other members of the crew.	1
We flew United from Seattle to Chicago so was dreading the long flight to Dublin. Flight attendants were nice and helpful and much to my surprise the food wasn't half bad. Comparatively speaking the seats were comfortable; certainly roomier than those on United. Upon boarding each seat had a pillow in it and there were free movies and TV programs to choose from. Landed in Chicago 45 minutes early.	1
Stockholm - Dublin slight delay but comfortable plane and the usual friendly staff. Please Aer Lingus enforce the carry on bag limits it was a full flight and nearly every passenger was hauling on a wheely suitcase. Those of us who had checked in luggage were asked to remove coats and duty free purchases from the overhead bins so that these suitcases could be accommodated which is both annoying and unfair!	1
I booked a London to Tokyo flight via Moscow as it was the cheapest fare and the journey time was good. We booked vegetarian meals and confirmed these via the booking agent Opodo. However when checking in it became apparent we had no vegetarian meal. The stewards on the first leg were great and rustled up a vegetarian meal for us they were good and I started to wonder what all the bad reviews were about. However during the next leg it was obvious - the staff never smiled and were not helpful with our vegetarian request. The inflight entertainment was not great a few new movies - it was a laugh to see movies from the 70's though. The return leg was not great we didn't even bother asking about the vegetarian meal as I couldn't face the stern expression on the steward. It was not a pleasant journey. Aeroflot is much cheaper than other airline and I would recommend it as it did the trick we arrived safely. So if you are happy to forego smiling staff have a passion for old Russian films and do not want vegetarian food you will love Aeroflot!	1
Like Eric said I don't understand the bad reviews. I have flown the Maun-JNB flight many times and everything has been great. Never had any delays. The last comments are from 2011 and 2010 and now I think they have a brand new fleet. My flight was nice - not the best aircraft.	1
We flew Maun-Johannesburg. Despite the reviews here I was pleasantly surprised. The plane looked new and the leather seats were comfortable. The 2 cabin crew were ok. The plane left on time and landed on time 2 hrs later.	1
17/8/2014 Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf AB6445. Dusseldorf to London Stansted F7 276 (with Etihad) 17 August. Our family have travelled with Air Berlin for years mostly within Europe no problems except now they have an inefficient incompetent partner for the route Dusseldorf/London Stansted called Etihad operated by Darwin airline based in Switzerland. Etihad is never on time and 17 Aug flight from Dusseldorf was first delayed by 2 hrs then another 1 hr + then cancelled. That made 2 flights that day cancelled no reason given at the gate. Air Berlin say they aren't responsible and there was absolutely nobody to help reschedule flights. Etihad Regional NEED to be represented at both airports because there was no staff whatsoever so no customer services to help any of the many passengers.	1
8th Aug 2014 London Stansted to Dusseldorf AB5825 and then 9th Aug Dusseldorf to Cancun AB7416 and return 23rd Aug Cancun to Dusseldorf AB7417 and Dusseldorf to London Stansted AB5826. Really good long haul cross Atlantic flights kind and helpful at staff check-in and for in-flight service. Good meals with drinks brought round in between. Planes seemed new with fresh seating and USB ports on the media screens. The short haul Stansted to Dusseldorf parts were delivered by Etihad Regional and again good in-flight service. The only slight negative was the time to check in on return they opened it 1.5 hours pre flight and completed 45 mins before the flight with only about 30 people in line the slowest check per person I've ever known. However Dusseldorf airport was lovely and smart for the wait time between flights. Avoided US Immigration hassles/poor customer service by flying Germany to Mexico.	1
Bangkok-Almaty (Business) Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. The Business Class was very good and liked the beds. There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected. These flights were still full.	1
London-Almaty. The best direct flight between London and Almaty. Service is very good cabin crew are all well presented and professional. My only criticism is that I found the selection of wines quite limited. Everything else was as you would expect from a leading international airline boarding inflight entertainment landing etc. I have been a customer of Air Astana for the last 10yrs and can say that services planes and routes have all improved.	1
Friday night back to Almaty they did brilliantly. Excellent selection of drinks served by staff who knew how to mix them well prepared fresh food friendly and professional cabin staff newish plane comfortable seats  good music selection (I even have to admit I found the crass candid-camera-esk overhead TV amusing too then off the aeroplane and out of the airport and into a taxi in 5 mins max.	1
London-Almaty and this airline seems to get better and better. It was streamlined and helpful from check-in to arrival. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful and did everything possible to make my journey pleasant. It took me a short while to work the seats but I slept very soundly when I had. There is plenty of space and it was an extremely comfortable way to get to Kazakhstan.	1
DUB-LIN and VRN-DUB - The usual Aer Lingus service. On time clean planes friendly FA's. Quite happy that they are enforcing the carry on luggage rule as planes now get off on time. I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay for food. Most EI flights are 2.5 hours or less. Eat before you leave or else bring your own food and stop complaining. I'm very happy with them and will continue to use them. For the fare you pay (if you book well in advance) I have few complaints about the service.	1
We were stranded in JFK on 31st Oct after our airline (a large American) had cancelled our flight for the second time as a result of the Super storm Sandy. The only flight they could re-schedule us for was on 8th Nov and the only customer service they offered was a card with a telephone number. We approached the Aer Lingus staff in JFK who despite having no obligation to help us said they would see what they could do. In the end they managed to accommodate us on their flights and got my family back to Dublin The Aer Lingus staff on the day showed customer service at its very best.	1
Very comfortable leather seat. Quick boarding at TXL. They gave snacks and drinks during the flight from TXL to VCE. Very polite and friendly crew.	1
Business class from Almaty to Bangkok. The comfort and service was of highest standard and compared favourably with airlines with better reputations.	1
Moscow to Almaty. This was a good flight it departed and arrived as schedules and the luggage was offloaded efficiently at Almaty. There was a slight hiccup with the check-in and I did not get the seat that I had pre-requested however I finished with a better seat. Flight service perfectly adequate and I was spoken to in English when they realised I was not a native Russian speaker. I had no problems on what was a comfortable flight.	1
Bangkok to Almaty. Very full flight and a booking error in my row which resulted an upgrade to Business Class. Food and service quite friendly with some preferences being given to those who had paid full business class fares. Seats were comfortable recliners and I was a little surprised with the legroom. Service was good and the English better than I expected. Economy class gives value for money but I think that Business Class does not.	1
Flew Dublin to Rome in A320. Flight was on time staff pleasant and seat pitch reasonable. My only quibble was that in Row15 service arrives last of all.	1
Moscow-Delhi Economy. Cabin almost full helpful and smiling stewardesses despite demanding passengers regarding their choice of meals. Missed a glass of wine but no alcohol on this segment.	1
Hong-Kong-Moscow and Moscow-Shanghai. I have to say out of all international airlines I've flown Aeroflot is the most out of date with their entertainment technology. The seats while old were leather and soft and I slept for the first time on a flight. Hong-Kong to Moscow was 1.5 hrs late due to winter storms. Trip to Shanghai was on time and the plane almost empty so every passenger could occupy an entire row. The food was average and the staff do not smile but that's just the culture. I would fly with them again one of the better airlines in the cheaper price bracket.	1
Flew ORD-TXL-STR STR-TXL-ORD. Was nervous after reading all of the comments here but the flight was very good. The IFE was perfect small TVs on the back of every seat in economy with more than enough movies TV shows music and games. Food was decent enough for the price water was served periodically. 5 bathrooms: more than enough. Staff was pleasant enough. Only problem is that the 2 hour layover in Berlin Tegel was hell. Berlin-Tegel Airport is designed terribly and was under construction when I flew but that isn't Air Berlin's fault.	1
We flew Economy with Air Berlin as it was the only carrier that offered a flight from Naples to Stockholm at a good price and we were pleasantly surprised with the whole experience after reading quite a few negative comments in this forum. There was a 3 hour stopover at Berlin Tegel which wasn't great but no issues whatsoever with Air Berlin. Both flights left on time aircraft was newish and clean service was pleasant despite a fully loaded plane and they also threw in coffee and a sandwich. No inflight entertainment but hey on a 2 hour flight who needs it? We were very happy with what was delivered for the price (Italy to Sweden for just $200) and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.	1
"I recently flew Gimpo - Jeju and Jeju - Busan and what a great experience! Fares were cheap included baggage and when I changed my flights to spend more time in Jeju I only had to pay the fare difference. The seats were the same pitch as Qantas (31"") flights departed close to schedule and drinks were served despite the short flight time. The only slight criticism I have is that their website is a bit tricky parts of it rely on Flash which may be why I couldn't get an English version to load on my mobile device also whenever I tried to put my passport details in I got an error - if this happens try selecting ""No passport"" this worked for me. I'll definitely choose them again if I'm flying their routes - great effort!"	1
URA-PEK via ALA return in Y. Checked-in online but offered a better seat at the airport which is nice of check-in agents. Domestic legs on newish A319 with plenty of legroom in economy. ALA-PEK on rather tired B767 with ancient bulky ceiling TV-sets and stale interiors but the flight and service very good. Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep. Excellent experience with Air Astana (although no competition whatsoever in the local market therefore fares are quite expensive.	1
I never had much of an issue with this airline. Ppolite staff food very reasonable a good selection of drinks and in-flight entertainment. On occasion the flights can be late but this is more due to the weather and the odd mechanical hiccup however this has improved. You may find this airline very expensive (Amsterdam to Atyrau) with 50% saving to be had via other routings. These comments relate to trips Amsterdam to Atyrau Atyrau to Aktau and Istanbul to Atyrau over the last 3 years.	1
I flew to Bangkok from Almaty December 2009. We had trouble at the beginning. Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.	1
DUB-CDG Return. A very pleasant trip good service from cabin crew. Slight delay returning due to circumstances outside Aer Lingus control. Catering is paid for but not too expensive. Competitive fares make this route worth considering on Aer Lingus.	1
I flew Moscow SVO to Helsinki with Aeroflot I'm very happy with the service very helpful staff. Spacious Economy Class and a very good value for more than an hour flight. No delays on time.	1
Moscow-Volgograd round trip on new and clean 737  Airbus 330 planes. Check-in and inflight service was excellent in spite of our very limited Russian skills. Good inflight meals at no charge. We had switched our overseas flight from Aeroflot to Delta because of poor Aeroflot reviews (should not have done that). The return Moscow-JFK Delta flight was 3 hrs late causing many on the plane to miss connections at JFK while two Aeroflot planes left on time and made their connections. SVO terminal was beautifully clean modern and bilingual with efficient service in stark contrast to the poor arrival image given by JFK.	1
Omsk-Moscow-St Petersburg. Small problems with check-in at Omsk and only received one boarding pass. Breakfast was good and the service leisurely for a 3 hrs plus flight. Plane was full and the flight left and landed on time. Was surprised that they had an English language paper on board. This is an improvement on previous internal flights. Moscow-St Petersburg is a short 80 min flight and received a quick and light second breakfast which was just adequate for this flight. Again the flight left and landed on time.	1
SVO-BKK in Business Class and was quite surprised. Flight attendants are 40+ ladies but cool and friendly food was very good even though it was a low calorie pre-order meal. The plane was without individual IFE but we received portable movie players with a decent selection. Overall on-board experience was great while airport experience was so-so. Business lounge at Sheremetyevo airport was awful with plastic forks almost no food available no A/C. Aeroflot Business Class is a very good value for money.	1
6/08/14 AB7421 ORD-TXL. 6/24/14 AB 7420 TXL-ORD. I had the privilege of flying Air Berlin business class last week from Berlin to ORD. It was my first time with Air Berlin. The seating was the best I have had. The staff were friendly and efficient. On my return from Berlin-ORD I had the best airline meal I have had. It began with a Thai beef salad and I selected Beef Slices in water chestnut sauce for an entree. Both salad and entree had very tender beef. The cold meal was also very good. A recent review said the new business seats were narrow. At 300+ pounds I found it to be fine. I'll definitely fly them again.	1
Dusseldorf to Madrid. Air Berlin is a very nice airline. They gave everyone a complementary sandwich and a drink. Entertainment was okay just a little hard if you are a bit far from the dropdown screen. Staff very helpful.	1
PUS-CJU B737 Short flight from us an to Jeju Island. Left and arrived on time. comfortable seating. No food served; just a 50cc bottle of water handed out. No inflight entertainment.	1
I flew with my family from Fukuoka to Busan for a holiday. Although we stayed for a night in Busan and then flew to Seoul the next day the airport staff were very helpful and friendly they helped me reserve seats for the second route with leg room. The ticket fee was still attractive even though it was during their New Year. No choice for the drink (only Jeju orange juice) inflight. No delays.	1
I recently flew Air Astana from Almaty to Dubai and return and I must say I was impressed with the level of service. We were late out of Almaty but that was not a real problem as the service on the plane was professional. The seat pitch is okay for the 4 hour or so flight to Dubai as is the food. Entertainment was via overhead video units but it was fine to view. No problems with disembarking in Dubai. Equally the return flight was good leaving Dubai at 2300 - good food and service on board.	1
"GUW-AMS B767-300 Business class. I have to say the service has greatly improved. The seating is classic but very spacious. The plane is aging but clean. The onboard service is fair to good and IFE surprisingly diverse. I checked no for ""value"" for money because this ticket costs double the price of a twice as long flight on CX or AF."	1
FRA-SVO-OVB. New and spotless A320 plane. Comfortable seats and decent food on both legs. Colleagues had warned me about SVO but found Terminal D in SVO to be first class: very efficient good signage good services. Both planes late by 30 mins but that's about the only negative thing I can say. All in all a good value for money.	1
SVO-HKG (return) in April 2011. I decided to take this trip because Aeroflot recently replaced old fleet on this route with new Airbus A330 and because ticket was quite cheap. The plane is really good food and service are good too. On both legs boarding was efficient and flights arrived on time. The drawback is departing from old terminal F while most Aeroflot flights depart from new terminal D. Check-in and security are much easier in D.	1
I use Aeroflot pretty often on my flights from Los Angeles to Moscow and domestic flights to Russian Far East. Food is great new A330-200 entertainment systems are very good with a big choice of movies. I am loyal to SkyTeam and was forced to used Delta a few times on my journeys to Russian. I realize that Aeroflot staff do not smile always but other things compensate for it. I'd rather not be hungry and bored with okay staff then be hungry and bored onboard of Delta planes.	1
TXL-JFK and return. Can't understand what all the bad reviews are about. Both flights were on time using an A330 with the cabin in a clean good condition. Not a lot of space in economy but I wouldn't say it was much worse than other European carriers. IFE is excellent with a very good selection of Movies and TV series. Food was OK but nothing to write about. Considering the low price and punctuality would definitely use them again. Only negative is Tegel airport which is simply not designed (or capable) of handling large aircraft - but that is not Air Berlin's fault.	1
I flew the OSL-TXL route on an A320. The plane was packed but the staff still did a great job. They gave a coloring book and stickers to my children. They enjoyed the flight. Water was served. The inflight magazine was in both German and English and had some good content. There was some turbulence coming into Berlin but the pilot handled it well and landed.	1
FUK-PUS return on an aged 737-400 clean and offering reasonable leg space. Check-in courteous despite I arrived pretty late. No inflight service for such a short flight they served orange juice but it was not necessary to do so if fares go lower. They have an interesting selection of duty free shopping on the plane it's worth trying it. Uneventful trips and luggage arrived safe and sound. I'd wish they offered more routes into Korea from Fukuoka. Very user-friendly website that allows to catch good fares and per it's seat selection. Flying BX was a nice surprise.	1
PUS-GMP. User-friendly website made the ticket purchasing easy. Departure delayed 20 minutes but the plane arrived on time in GMP. Orange juice and water served on a very short flight. FAs were friendly and efficient. Seat pitch and leg room may be a bit tight but I believe it's common for an LCC. Overall a great choice for those who want to take a domestic flight in South Korea.	1
Busan to Jeju. Flight attendants great and tried to have a little fun with the passengers. On the way they served drinks (water/juice/coffee) and a fortune cookie. They also had some kind of draw for a few different gift certificates. Airplane very new and in excellent condition. Seats were quite close together so my legs were almost pressed against the seat in front of me even though it wasn't reclined (if you're tall it might be irritatingly tight). Overall though a pretty good airline and I will fly with them again.	1
Very good considering the fares. I even wonder when they serve drinks on a 50 minutes flight (Seoul - Pusan). I'd rather have a cheaper ticket.	1
GUW-IST-GUW A320. Check in smooth and the flight was on time. The plane was a new A320. IFE was limited but this was a 3.5 hour flight. The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights. From Kazakhstan we do not have much choice of airlines and Air Astana is still the only one with a descent safety record so I prefer to use it despite the ever increasing prices.	1
Air Astana is right up there with other non-mainstream airlines who do more to please than most. Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant. Service to Atyrau has improved leaps and bounds from the days when a worker cigarette in mouth and large hosepipe in hand used to bang the hull of the plane to talk to the pilot about refuelling. The airport is still a bus station though.	1
Almaty - Atyrau - Amsterdam in Business. Seats are comfortable although not lay flat and space is more than enough. Their duvets are perfect. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Food is good service is second to none. Aircraft was clean and flights operated on time. On the ground staff are very helpful. However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long. All in all very pleased with service its just a shame that terminal facilities let down the rest of the service. Sort that out and its 10/10! Keep up the good work.	1
Flight from DUB-LHR to catch a connecting flight on another airline. Aircraft was clean and comfortable FAs polite and helpful. Flight on time. Only drawback was deplaning at LHR - passengers who were not connecting to another flight exited the aircraft first from the main door onto a jet bridge. Passengers with connecting flights exited last through the rear door down stairs and met a waiting bus. It seemed backwards to make passengers who might have tight connections wait until last to exit. Also since passengers were trying to exit from both the front and rear of the aircraft single-aisle aircraft it was difficult and time consuming for everyone to leave their seat collect their carry on and make their way to the exits. Perhaps this is a restriction coming from the airport rather than Aer Lingus but it seems like something that could be improved.	1
Third time on a transatlantic flight with Aer Lingus. This time we travelled from Dublin to New York and back from Chicago to Dublin. Both flights on time. Clean and new aircraft good food excellent service and great films onboard!	1
DUB - LPA Return. All flights on time. Flights comfortable. Cabin crew very friendly and efficient. Aer Lingus is my airline of choice out of Ireland. Shame no IFE on flights to Canaries as flights are 4 hours in duration.	1
Moscow SVO-Astrakhan ASF-Moscow SVO outward by Aeroflot inward by Nordavia. Access to SVO is tiresome but airport is first class : easy clean and helpful. Both flights on time. Aeroflot a new Airbus Nordavia an old 737. Pilot information good cabin service impeccable light food dull but adequate.	1
Smooth sailing on all four legs: JFK to Berlin Berlin to Gdansk Warsaw to Berlin and Berlin back to NY. Flights were punctual staff was very friendly and attentive food was decent price was right. Legroom a bit tighter than our recent flights on American and British Air. But overall totally fine.	1
Very good friendly and uncomplicated service. Like the fixed prizing. Makes you wonder why it has to be so stressful travelling in Europe with the likes of Ryanair etc. Would always choose Air Busan again.	1
Air Busan was what I would expect from a LCC. Seat pitch a little tight but enough for me. Flight attendants a little abrasive but you can't judge an airline by one flight attendant! Overall good airline and it serves its purpose well; affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect. South Korea is small so flights with Air Busan are only in the 1 hour range!	1
The have good cabin crew quality of food is good. Their fleet is new enough and I know from some sources that they do their best to provide safety and best service. Sometimes it seems that the prices are too high but if you order tickets via internet you will get a discount especially on trips with some promotions. But this service is worth to be paid.	1
Moscow-Astana-Almaty return. First sectors a 3.5h night flight and wasn't really crowded. I had a row for myself so laid down and had a sleep. Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.	1
Went to DUB via ORD. Great experience! Helpful Customer Service. We arrived 1.5 hours early to DUB and on- time back to ORD. First Rate Movies and decent food.	1
Dublin-Malaga Malaga-Dublin. Onboard A330 which was fantastic! Onboard one of Aer Lingus' largest aircraft for a 2 hour flight! Took off on time clean cabin flight attendants and inflight entertainment was fantastic! Would recommend them.	1
Flew MAN-DUB-BOS-DUB-MAN. Cannot speak too highly of transatlantic sectors. Good time keeping clean cabin for today's airlines reasonable food. IFE was adequate for flight duration. Seat was comfortable enough again for the trip duration. What made Aer Lingus stand out on both transatlantic sectors was the service and efficiency of the cabin crew. My only gripe is the connection in Dublin where all of a sudden from being in a business class environment one has to jostle with other passengers. Perhaps they could look at having a dedicated point such as Swiss do in ZRH. Also the security point staff seemed overwhelmed with the scanner operator having to open bags too. I hasten to suggest that over worked staff can lead to lapses!	1
Amsterdam-Moscow-Beijing and back. Friendly staff good meals and good seats. Only in the flights from Amsterdam to Moscow and back is no inflight entertainment. IFE Moscow - Beijing good and a lot of choices of music movies. We had friendly staff even smiles sometime. Meals good different and good quality. A few little delays but nothing more then a few minutes. One problem is that we fly on the old terminal F the people are rude and unhelpful but the new terminals are better.	1
Brussels-Moscow-Beijing and back. Arrived in Moscow 15 minutes late but departure to Beijing was one hour late. Reason (de-icing of the aircraft) was announced. A320 on the Brussels- Moscow stretch older B767 on the Moscow-Beijing stretch. Service onboard was correct and friendly and meals of decent quality. I feel that good quality was offered given the very low fare.	1
BKK-SVO-CDG. Long lines slow and chaotic check-in at BKK. Planes spotless and economy seats reasonably comfortable. Crew did not stop passengers from standing up and opening the overhead compartment while taxiing. Onboard service was minimal. BKK-SVO crew performed their duty but without smiles. SU does not serve alcohol on economy class for the BKK-SVO route. Onboard food has nothing special to mention about. Limited drinks and entertainment choices. SVO transit security checks extremely slow since there was only one counter. SVO has been renovated since I last passed through this airport. I did not expect much and the ticket was the cheapest!	1
Flew FRA-TXL-SZG. Excellent Airline. Food was good. Helps so much to have a few screens to look at during a flight. The staff were so kind. The funny thing I noticed was they advertise more for Etihad than they do for themselves. Would definitely fly them again.	1
Our flight was great and the service wonderful. Staff polite and welcoming and the food good. We had first run movies TV shows games. We flew from New York to Ireland to Italy and back. Would recommend this airline 100%.	1
I've flown Aer Lingus twice a round trip from Helsinki to Dublin and another round trip from Dublin to Bologna. All flights were on time A320 nice and clean with leather seats that have head rests. Flight attendants have always been friendly providing excellent service. Check-in at the airport and getting an assigned seat is particularly nice and makes standing in line for boarding unnecessary. Great value for money and I fly with them on every opportunity.	1
BKK to Madrid via Moscow. Except for a bottleneck at Moscow airport the return flights were okay - good food limited inflight entertainment reasonably pleasant cabin staff. I would fly with them again if they continue to offer their low prices. The bottleneck at Moscow - transit passengers had to go through one security machine - completely inadequate for the number of passengers.	1
Abu Dhabi to Phuket on an Etihad ticket. Air Berlin flies this sector on behalf of Etihad. A satisfying experience. The plane was only around 60% full so I had 2 seats to myself. The seats were a bit cramped so it would be uncomfortable if the flight was full. Very nice and friendly crew who chatted and socialized with the passengers. Food was not bad at all I was actually dreading German food due to my previous experiences with Lufthansa but Air Berlin's food was obviously from Abu Dhabi airport and tasted good. Smooth flight no complaints at all.	1
Moscow to Seoul with Aeroflot. I had trouble at Moscow Sheremetyevo airport at check-in on 27th January my seat booking could not be found even though I had rung the day before and was assured I had a confirmed seat. I was sent to Domestic terminal D to a Korean Air office that did not exist - I rang the airline and again was told my seat was booked and confirmed and after going to the service desk at Terminal D being yelled at by a charming girl I did receive help and a man from Aeroflot escorted me back to Terminal F. I had 4 attendants then check me in and one was waiting at the gate to see that I was OK and to tell me to checkin again at Seoul for my flight to Sydney. The flight was fine food was good and the service was fine. Russian airports are very difficult at the best of times I only speak a little Russian but I have travelled with Russians and it is also difficult when there are problems for them as customer service is terrible one. Russia is not a country where it is easy to travel - at airports there is often no trolleys no one who speaks English and rude service.	1
JFK-Moscow-Kiev. Food and drink were free unlike many American carriers and found the food to be quite good. I did experience a horrible lack of organization and enforcement of the rules. No one would take their seat and flight attendants would not intervene to get things moving faster. Thus my flight from JFK was 20 minutes late taking off. Other than that the service was professional. Dinner was served quickly along with several rounds of drinks none of which were alcoholic. During landing I experienced the same disorganization and lack of enforcement of rules. When were on final approach to Moscow a woman entered the bathroom and would not leave. There was some attempt at removing her but not nearly enough. The flight to Kiev was more of the same passengers refused to take their seats until the plane was actually moving. There as little to no attempt by the crew to seat them. Our flight was delayed over a half hour because of this. Inflight service was good perhaps better than the flight between JFK to Moscow. Despite the short flight a meal was served and drinks came frequently. Overall my complaint was the lack of effort to get the passengers seated. The flight attendants knew enough English to make ordering food and drinks easy despite me not knowing a word of Russian.	1
TXL-MXP return. Pleasant and straightforward flight on time. Clearly not the most exciting option as it is a low budget carrier but excellent value for money.	1
Flew Cologne-Berlin/TXL return. Modern aircraft both flights with Boeing 737-700 one brand new with Dreamliner interior very nice. Good service from flight crew got 2 drinks and offered sweet or salty snack. Crew was nice and smiling. Pilot informed during flight and arrived on time in Berlin. Baggage was quick on belt. TXL is an old airport and that is not to blame Air Berlin for that. Return flight was nice as well crew gave me a 3rd hot drink that was a nice touch. Plane was not full and the service was nice and with a smile. Much better than Germanwings. I wish Air Berlin would fly CGN-HAM.	1
BRS-DUB-BOS. We flew from Bristol to Boston connecting in Dublin. The regional flight was on time with quite poor legroom but we arrived early in Dublin. We changed terminal on one of the buses. The 11am flight from Dublin to Boston doesn't clear immigration in Dublin but it was no big deal. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary but things you had to pay for were obviously overpriced. The crew were pleasant and the entertainment was fine. Overall the flights were very good.	1
Travelled to USA - economy class outbound and business class inbound. Service was superb both ways. Staff friendly on both transatlantic flights and on Glasgow - Dublin / Dublin - Glasgow flights. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Aer Lingus again.	1
It seems the common thread with most fliers on Aeroflot is that planes and flight service is good but the Airport in Moscow is no where near international standards. I agree! I flew one way from Yerevan Armenia to Moscow and on to Los Angeles. New Airbus planes good leg room and above average meals. The flight crew seemed like they would rather be elsewhere and were not very interested to assist when someone had taken my seat. I had to stand for a while and then took matters into my own hands and found another seat.	1
"Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only ""5 more minutes!"". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work."	1
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Moscow Sheremetyevo. Amsterdam to Moscow can be compared to a flight with any European airline you get even a warm meal. Moscow to Bangkok was excellent service was good even though the crew did not speak good English. Announcements in English were very difficult to understand. You get a warm meal twice and in between drinks and snacks. The selection of drinks is awfully poor for a long haul flight. Aeroflot does not serve any alcohol on flights to Bangkok but they also have not replaced those alcohol drinks with anything else. You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music. The only negative thing we could find was the fact that Russian passengers do not take safety matters very seriously. We heard mobile phones ringing and passengers going to use the toilet during approach! Apart from the routine announcements and checking seat belts the crew was not interested in telling passengers to behave.	1
Took this flight long haul from JFK to Poland. The seats were small and the leg room is very small. I usually travel this route through Aer Lingus which has a lot more space and more comfortable but unfortunately they discontinued this route. The flight attendants for my flight was rude and not nice. They didn't smile and if you asked for anything it seemed like you were bothering them. The food was the worst. Would not use this airline again. The price was very good though.	1
TXL-TFS 5 hours flight was on time friendly flight attendant but the free food was not good at all. There was the choice cheese or chicken sandwich. The food you have pay for was a little bit better but still not worse the money. The flight was not expensive so I would recommend this airline.	1
Flew from DUB-BCN. Never a problem on EI clean plane nice crew reasonable (ish) price for snacks and drinks and T2 in Dublin is a breeze. Why they don't try and sort it out and try to become a 4 star airline is beyond me if Virgin Australia can do it and they can't touch EI on some levels then what's stopping them?	1
Flights LHR-DUB return. Check in at LHR got us an earlier flight aircraft clean and seating very comfortable. Cabin crew on both sectors were very helpful legroom ok for a short haul flight. First experience with Aer Lingus and will use them again. Overall very pleased.	1
BHX-DUB-ORD. Very professional crew frequent updates from the pilots arrived 50 mins ahead of schedule food was very nice for economy class. Cabin crew very attentive and always checking up to make sure everything is okay and offering more free tea and coffee. Cabin was very clean and bright and quite quiet. IFE had a large range. Pre clearance at Dublin airport was fantastic and meant we were out within 25 mins once we reached Chicago.	1
Athens to Moscow Sheremyetevo return. New A320 polite staff good food. Price was cheap. I would fly again with Aeroflot.	1
Copenhagen - Moscow - Havana. First flight an A319 seats quite comfortable with good legroom and delicious dinner. Moscow-Havana new A330-200 seats good although they don't recline were much. The biggest drawback was that IFE offered a very limited amount of movies and TV shows no where near main competitors.	1
DUS-TXL-MAD. AB cancelled the original DUS-MAD flight which was quite a nuisance. So had to fly via Berlin which added 3 hrs since they didn't offer to fly direct on their OW-partner Iberia. On the positive side: very punctual flawless performance. Free drinks and a nice snack and only 80 euros one way. Seating in 737-800 to TXL cramped. Luckily an empty middle seat. Otherwise it would be hardly bearable.	1
SZG-HAM-SZG on A320 both ways. Long time ago since I last flew with Air Berlin and it was a positive surprise. Both flights on time. Cabin was very clean and spotless seats are nice and not cramped. We even got coffee and tea on this one hour flight. FA's very friendly. Overall a very good experience and I would fly Air Berlin again on European routes.	1
I flew from Shannon to Boston yesterday 7 July and must say that I was both shocked and horrified that three of the female cabin crew including the cabin manager were chewing gum whilst serving food etc. I expect that here by the staff on US carriers but not Aer Lingus. Otherwise the flight was faultless.	1
Most recently SXF-DUB-SXF return. The economy class product its getting better after dipping for a few years. Most of the A320s now seem to have the more comfortable seats with moveable headrests and a little more legroom than before (29 rows now instead of 30 I think). I'm an occasional flyer on this airline maybe half a dozen times a year mostly Spain-Ireland or Germany-Ireland. The staff are still pleasant if less experienced. It's a significant notch above Ryanair in overall product and service and worth a premium (often there is none). Pricing overall is competitive.	1
JFK to DUS. Great flight. 8 hour trip non stop great entertainment and staff service was excellent.	1
DUS-AUH on December 24th 2013. Air Berlin 7460 code-shared by Etihad. The seats don't offer much space but I was very impressed by the personal entertainment system. It basically looked like a tablet - very sharp display touch screen fast response. I've haven't seen such a great system anywhere else yet (I only fly economy though). When somebody's unit stopped working the flight attendant brought a replacement! The only drawback of this was the fact that it was a night time flight so I tried to get some sleep rather than spend the time watching movies.	1
LHR-DUB flight was very well done by all accounts quiet and well maintained. The staff seemed very courteous and keen to engage in small-talk with customers. DUB-LHR flight not brilliant more down to bad luck than anything else on this flight it was more the people I was with that caused aggravation behind me shaking my seat back and forth as if it was a play-thing. This wasn't helped by the person in front of me reclining back so there little room. I am not questioning the plane attendants or cleanliness.	1
Southend to Dublin. Excellent airport new route from May. Aircraft was nice clean ART42 nice leather seats which had plenty of legroom for the 1 hr 35 minute flight. Excellent inflight with smiling hostess.	1
DUB-AMS ORK-AMS DUB-LGW CDG-SXF. I'm a regular user! Staff are always lovely and will go the extra mile to help you if you need it. Planes are clean and on time. I'm taking a longish haul to LA in August and am going via DUB not only because they have excellent fares but I'd pick them over United Delta BA or Air France any time.	1
DME-DUS-VRA and back. Excellent airline which offers very competitive prices but also good service. The flights from Moscow and back were on time. The connections in Dusseldorf went smoothly. The transatlantic flights were great. I enjoyed excellent entertainment system which provided wide selection of great movies and music. The food were very tasty and fresh. The staff were very efficient and polite. All in all a very pleasant experience. I would recommend not to economize though and pay some extra fee for the preferred seat selection since the leg room is rather scarce.	1
Flew from Dublin to Boston return with a group of 65 teenagers. Check-in was straightforward and both flights pleasant and uneventful. Excellent product with good crew and well maintained cabin. No complaints!	1
"JFK-DUB Nice flight on a new clean airbus. Food was excellent and IFE was fine with recent movies and plenty of music and games. The seat was not that comfortable as it was not a ""Lay flat"" but had a slight angle. Still managed a few hours sleep. Crew attentive and pleasant throughout."	1
ORD-DUB-ORD. Great service both during the check-in process and onboard on both flights. Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.	1
Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day. Luggage delivery both in Toronto and Montreal was shockingly slow.	1
Vienna to Rome in October 2013. Vienna has this amazing facility where if you fly Air Berlin or Austrian you can check your hold luggage in at the city train station up to a day before and take the express train out to the airport. We made use of this facility and despite being a bit doubtful everything worked perfectly. Thanks to this we had no waiting time at check-in or at the airport. Boarding was orderly and quick even with only one person at the gate. Flight crew was friendly the plane being a newish A320. Inflight snack was okay nothing special but I've seen worse airplane food. On arrival in Rome we had to wait over half an hour for our luggage but that seems to be par for the course there. All in all I'd fly them again.	1
"Travelled from Berlin to Chicago. I generally have low expectations of airlines today especially when travelling with my national flag carrier British Airways. I was pleasantly surprised by this flight. Yes Economy Class seat pitch is just 30"" but the scooped out seat backs help in that respect so you gain a little knee room. The food was pretty good that is to say I've had a great deal worse and the crew were friendly and attentive at all times. I particularly liked the entertainment system which worked well and had large seatback screens. All in all for an Economy Class flight of nearly nine hours not a bad experience."	1
"FRA-TXL-FRA: Just 55min flight but complementary snacks and soft drink in the afternoon flight and also complementary warm bread and soft drink in the early morning flight. Cabin attendants were friendly on both flights. Even landing on time at FRA due to full spots we had to wait on a taxiway for 10min. Outsourcing ground staff at TXL could not answer where the AB lounge was. ""I don't know"" with smile."	1
Recently travelled from Edinburgh to Dublin and the plane was delayed 40 minutes. On our return flight the plane was once again delayed 30 minutes. In March we made the same journey using Ryanair and there were no delays. It is very difficult to contact Aer Lingus as they don't give email contact details.	1
GLA-DUB-GLA. Very reasonable flights but we did not check-in any bags. Check-in with iPad was simple and straightforward and we breezed through security in both directions. ATR-72 plane was ideal for this short flight. The propellers are a lot louder than a jet plane but the 2x2 seat layout is much more suitable for most travellers than the usual 3x3 you expect on sort haul flights. The planes were comfortable and well maintained and the service both ways was professional and friendly. Overall a perfectly acceptable for the short route with an excellent frequency to Glasgow. Much better value for money than the competition (Ryanair from PIK which is invariably more expensive and less frequent). My only real complaint is the need to bus passengers out to a very remote stand in Dublin.	1
"SKG-Dusseldorf-Stansted. Flight went very well. All on time. Polite staff and good ""meal"" on board. I would recommend."	1
LHR-JFK via Dublin. Lounge access at Heathrow and very nice lounge in Dublin - impressive airport. Flight from LHR-DUB was very full and uncomfortable. Flight from DUB was in new and very clean A330 - only 10 passengers in business class. Excellent service and very impressed with the food quality. Seat was comfortable and spacious. All in all a good experience - would not like an overnight flight as the seat was not at all comfortable for sleeping - angled type and impossible to get comfortable in that position - also a bigger pillow than the regular economy version would have been appreciated.	1
Dublin-Barcelona: 29 teenagers and three teachers. Ground staff were not very good they seated the group in different rows but they handled hand luggage in an efficient elegant and professional way. No room inside the cabin? No problem they check it in for you at no extra cost. One appreciates such details when dealing with a bunch of students and all their souvenir purchases. As for the flight - peaceful even though I could have used some more leg space.	1
BHX-DUB-JFK return. Short flight BHX-DUB was fine. Clean plane friendly attendants but cramped leg space which is fine for such a short flight. I had prepaid for my seat selection but due to aircraft change DUB-JFK I was moved to back of plane. I complained to attendant at gate in DUB who apologised and offered to put me in a window exit seat as there were no other aisles available. I preferred the aisle and so stayed with it which turned out to be fine. FA's are for the most part very friendly except for a couple on the return who were efficient but not really friendly. The best thing is being able to go through customs for the US in Dublin on the way out. No lines and easy to get through. ATR on the way back from DUB-BHX looked very old and not very well taken care of. Overall I liked Aer Lingus and plan to fly them again next time I go to the States.	1
DUB-MAD. Airbus A320. Boarded 30 minutes prior to departure and left ahead of schedule. Terminal 2 in Dublin very clean modern and spacious. Cabin crew friendly efficient and professional throughout. Purchased drinks and snacks which were of good quality and sold at reasonable prices. Seats leather and comfortable with acceptable legroom. All in all a good flight. The only negative aspect was Madrid Terminal 1 which is old fashioned and lacked any decent facilities.	1
Flew out economy but paid extra to get 35A which is an exit row seat. Seat was ok but a bit snug width-wise. Queues for the loos tended to stand right in front of me so it was a busy area. Inflight entertainment was good but would benefit from more recent films. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a. I didn't get to choose as I missed my original flight due to a connecting flight cancellation so was just happy to have made the flight. Seat was ok but uncomfortable in fully flat mode - it would have been a lot more comfortable with an extra cushion layer. Flight attendants were friendly but rushed to get everything done before people wanted to sleep. Food was good but some choices ran out quite quickly. I liked the idea of pre-ordering breakfast and letting them know if you wanted to be woken for it or not. Overall a good flight, a lot better than the experience I had on my connecting flights with Jazz	1
DUS-JFK Business class flight 7450. Good service good staff good food good wine and drinks but the seat was horrible.	1
ZRH-DUB-ZRH. Tale of two airlines. Web check-in on the way out went well. Full load but crew was helpful arranging hand luggage. Dealt well with some difficult passengers. Crew professional some very friendly. Check-in machines on the return worked well. Passengers seated in the back where allowed to take big hand luggage with them. Those in the front were not so felt sorry for those who paid even more than for a standard seat as they either had their bags checked in for pick up or had to store it at the back of the plane. Front two crew members absolutely unmotivated and yelling at passengers. Prices no longer that cheap. Terminal 2 is ok. Flight to Dublin would be a 8. Back would be a 3. Buy onboard choice is good and prices are ok.	1
"GVA-DUB and DUB-MCO. GVA-DUB in economy and DUB-MCO (Orlando) in Business. Both flights on time and impressed by the cabin staff. The Dublin to Orlando flight was lovely - very nice food and wine(s). Seat - not a flat bed and was very comfortable for sitting for sleeping it was not and I cannot imagine spending a night in it. Our bags were tagged through from GVA-MCO and when we checked in for DUB-MCO flight only 2 could be located. Counter staff went out of their way to locate and re-tag the ""missing"" bag. Pre-clearance for the US was speedy and pleasant. All in all we were very impressed - service and price both right!"	1
Smooth check-in aided by a friendly agent in Montreal. First leg to Toronto left and arrived on time. A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable.	1
Initially I was reluctant to fly Air Canada after all the bad press about their service and quality but I can only give a big thumbs up for overall service and friendliness of the crew. Food quality is poor, but no worse than most other airlines.	1
My flight was on 9/1. I took the 2 hour flight from Zurich to Dusseldof and then Dusseldof to JFK. There is no sign outside Zurich airport about Air Berlin you have to discover that its Check In area is at 3. Check-in line was short and easy. The plane arrived at Dusseldof with no gate so a bus took you to the door. Once you exited the door you enter Germany. You have no idea where you were. I found out I had to move from the arrivals area to the departures area. I had to go trough the security check and then get my passport stamped. The inflight service and food were excellent. There were two meals. Flight attendant provided non-stop service and distributed water bottles. The programs on the monitor were excellent and the screen has very good resolution. The flight map was not working.	1
I fly twice a week LHR-DUB. Generally acceptable but quite average. Services mostly on time and the journeys smooth. The Aer Lingus Dublin lounge is very pleasant and the staff helpful. Many cabin staff have an unpleasant attitude that suggests we should be thanking them for giving us the opportunity to fly with them - we expect to be treated with at least a bit of respect! The loyalty scheme is not great - they will not provide points for basic non-flexible flights.	1
DUB-TFS-DUB. Great airline to fly with when travelling with children. Flight attendants seem to make even more of an effort with them. Like the look of their new inflight menu and what we bought onboard was tasty. T2 is a pleasure compared to what DUB was previously.	1
MAD-IAD. Good value for money a step up on the appalling service that we expect from the legacy US carriers but pretty minimal. This is a code share with United and for all intents a United flight in Aer Lingus livery and standard legacy service issues (complimentary and edible meal but you have to pay for alcohol and snack services). A330 was clean and serviceable. Economy had the usual cramped seats. IFE system is good. For the price it is good value.	1
GLA to ORD via DUB return. The flight to Dublin was with Aer Arann which was fine for the 50 minute flight. Flight to Chicago on A330-300 and we sat in a small three row cabin just behind business class which was excellent. Crew were friendly and professional and the meal was standard economy fare. Only one bar run so if you wanted wine with your meal you had to purchase it. The return flight was only 6.5 hours which was great and the catering was very tasty. Overall a very good product by Aer Lingus.	1
JFK-TXL return in Economy. Overall quite satisfied with Air Berlin. Check-in at JFK quick and staff accommodating in helping find me a good aisle seat (I am rather tall). Gate staff and boarding were fine. AVOD fine although TV choices were a bit limited. Seats are comfortable legroom should be more than adequate for someone under six feet. Cabin crew were polite drinks service was punctual liked the whole bottles of water handed out. Food was merely decent. Return flight same comments although TXL gates leave a lot to be desired. Overall I would recommend AB; despite their lower cost they are indeed better than most United States carriers when it comes to Economy long-haul.	1
"Overall very satisfied with Air Berlin. Returned from a cruise which ended in Venice. First took a short flight to Dusseldorf to then catch the connection to JFK. All connections were made on time. The Air Berlin flight staff were all very congenial. Was able to watch three movies on their entertainment system to pass the time. Food was good. ""Open"" bar even better. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again."	1
We are frequent business class travellers this was our first time with Aer Lingus from LHR to MCO via DUB. The whole experience was excellent. Crew were professional but friendly seats comfortable the food delicious and choice of wines good. Given the price we paid - roughly half that of the other airlines we generally use - the service represents great value for money. A shame they don't offer business class on European services but we were still able to use their lounges at LHR and DUB.	1
Dublin-Budapest return. Very organised and efficient boarding with on-time departure from DUB. Smooth flight and early arrival into BUD. Cabin crew courteous although a little functional. Return flight delayed 40 minutes. Pilot and crew apologetic for delay. Plenty of information given on routing arrival and weather. Cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. Problems with excessive hand-luggage is regular on this flight but this was dealt with at check-in and by onboard crew efficiently.	1
TXL to SOF return. Really can't complain about their short haul product - both flights were on time a drink and a snack offered and crew on both legs were friendly enough. At least the short haul service is comparable to established airlines such as Lufthansa or BA. Will definitely use them again in the future.	1
BRU-DUB-BRU. Airbus A320. Both flights on time. New planes with decent seat pitch. Attendants friendly and professional. Lots of information from the cockpit. Good value for money!	1
Dublin to JFK November 2011. Boarded Airbus A330 on time staff both pleasant and efficient ensuring a quick boarding had seat just behind bulkhead for business class. This area contains 12 or 14 seats and is worth paying extra for - comfortable and entertainment excellent. The flight was nice crew keeping us informed on route and weather etc meals passable at best! However on par with most other carriers from my experience overall a nice flight and felt well looked after.	1
Recently had a pleasure trip to Boston, Cape Cod and New York. Unfortunately before we left I broke my foot and was on crutches for the trip duration. We signed up for handicap assistance through Air Canada. They were our flight provider for every leg of our journey. I am so impressed with the service Air Canada provided. At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection. Everyone who helped was courteous, experienced and efficient. It made the trip so much easier, and there were some very tight connections, especially in Toronto. Thank you so much for your outstanding service Air Canada. My only complaint is the new $20 baggage fee which is the only reason my review is a 9 instead of a full 10. I wish it did not exist	1
"TXL-VIE a weekend trip 26/7-28/7. Both flights delayed: in Berlin they announced 10 mins but it turned to be 25 mins when we boarded. There was an apology from the captain. Return flight also delayed this time nobody announced anything and we had to wait. When for a 55 mins flight you have a delay of 20 mins it is not that good. I found the crew not necessarily rude but there was no feedback from them there were just doing their job and waiting to finish and go home. I keep asking myself how small a sandwich can become? At Air Berlin they succeeded to make the snack smaller and smaller. The Inflight Entertainment is becoming more and more ""commercial"" and there are no more films or cartoons."	1
Several day return flights DUB-LHR and DUB-MAN. Quite expensive in most cases as booked quite late but were either not much more expensive than Ryanair or less when you factor in that you would have to pay for priority boarding with Ryanair whereas can book a seat for free on Aer Lingus. But there's no comparison between the two. Very good experience and T2 at Dublin is a fantastic improvement on T1. AL have just launched a new Sky Cafe menu that looks tempting and very well presented although it is a bit misleading to be presenting the full Irish breakfast on bone china when it actually comes in a silver foil tray! Cabin crew without exception very professional and friendly although when I was standing at the back of the cabin waiting to disembark at Manchester it was a bit sad to hear two of them complaining about their jobs. It's not the same as it used to be. But given the choice I would choose AL over any of their competitors out of Dublin.	1
BHX-DUB return. I have flown this route with Ryanair and although it is marginally cheaper (£5 or so) Aer Lingus is worth it. Much more comfortable cabin and seats friendly staff and excellent service. Arrived to destination early.	1
I went out of my way to take the new Air Canada Dreamliner and it was worth it. Although the Toronto to Copenhagen flight is relatively short - only 7 hours - it gave me a chance to experience the excellent new product and service. Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips. I don't have big hips. What I also loved about this pod is plenty of storage space. It was worthwhile to fly via Toronto to Europe from New York, just to avoid the American airlines.	1
Even on this very short 65 min flight from New York to Toronto, Air Canada gets it right. The Embraer 190 has a spacious 1-2 business class layout, with comfy cushy seats. What impressed me most is that we had a proper meal-service which I very much appreciated. This is very rare in North American skies these days.	1
Very satisfied with my first long-distance trip on Air Berlin. Kind and humorous staff both on the planes and at the airports. The food was tasty and more than enough also plentiful drink runs. Then before the staff retires for about 2 hours one receives a small bottle of water-never had that happen before. As can be seen the staff presence is great throughout the flight. The Inflight Entertainment is good too although the TV series were a bit outdated. The plentiful amount of films made up for that again though. On the night flight we were given a large amenity kit with tooth brush and paste socks ear plugs and a eye mask. Only problem is the tiny seat pitch. Even if the person in front of you doesn't put back his chair your knees touch the seat in front of you.	1
DUB-MCO. Assisted to the whole family in getting seats at the front of economy class. Dublin is a very clean airport to fly through but I went with Aer Lingus before the big move to terminal 2. Terminal 1 is still very nice. During the flight the cabin crew were nice and food was lovely. All together a lovely flight.	1
DUB-ALC. Flew on an A320 both ways. Very high density and seats tight. Delay of 30 mins both ways. Very friendly staff and actually made you feel that you were important to them as a person not a customer. Food was lovely and landing was extremely smooth as usual.	1
We were a bit apprehensive about flying with Canada Rouge given the amount of criticism it gets. But it offered the best direct option from Vegas to Calgary. Our 737 flight was full, but the coordinated boarding process got everyone aboard quite quickly. Service was attentive - the FAs look over-casual, but the guy who looked after my wife was good with pillows and blanket. Perfect 10/10 landing in Calgary - complimented the co-pilot on his effort. We also flew Vancouver to LA in an upgraded 767. Again, full plane, but luggage space and legroom quite adequate. Entertainment via iPads.	1
"As a UK expat, I've done this route (YVR -LHR) dozens and dozens of times and have now taken the ridiculous step of flying via Calgary or Edmonton instead of taking the direct flight as the new ""High Capacity"" configuration on this route is outrageously bad. Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few ""Premium Economy"" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement.  My advice: take a connecting flight on a different plane type with a sensible seat configuration. Inflight meals, entertainment and staff are usual AC standards - nothing special but getting better. I'm usually asleep most of the flight so I'll defer to other passengers for more details on this aspect."	1
I just wanted to recount the excellent customer service I received regarding an unfortunate circumstance concerning a return trip to Aruba from Toronto last year. The agent at the ticket counter should be complimented on his empathy and understanding. However, I should also mention that I was disappointed when no attempt was made to inform me about changes made to the flight, especially since the departing flight from Toronto was delayed by one day. In spite of this disappointment I would continue to fly Air Canada.	1
AUH - HKT and return as part of Etihad codeshare. Out in old business class configuration and return in new configuration which is the same as Etihad's business class. Food and beverage offer was not quite as sophisticated as Etihad's but not far from it and I found the food to be very tasty and well presented. The staff were also good in my opinion - being warm and attentive. The old business class seat would not be that comfortable for sleeping on an overnight flight but the layout actually worked well for a daytime flight. IFE was good with enough variety and choice to keep most people happy. All in all I was quite impressed and would be happy to fly their long haul business class product again!	1
Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.	1
DUB-LIN and BLQ-DUB. M Wickham's comments re: Venice are interesting. I had the same experience flying back from Bologna where the captain made reference to problems on the ground. Took an age to get people to the gate and onto the buses to the plane. No reason for it. Just typical Italian laid back attitude. Still made up time on the way back and only ended up 5 mins late. Both flights were fine on time clean aircraft and friendly FA's.	1
Air Canada is known for poor food and very poor entertainment options (the television programs are very limited and don't change regularly) but the seats are good in economy and excellent when you have a flight with the pod configuration in business.	1
We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond.	1
Air Berlin from TXL to VCE and back. Everything went extremely smoothly. Free seat next to me (as a Topbonus Gold member) pre-ordered food was on board and very nice (Indian vegetarian curry) cabin crew very friendly and professional both flights a few minutes ahead of schedule luggage among the first 5 bags on belt. Air Berlin at its best!	1
We came prepared we flew from LAX to DUS. Flight was smooth and food ok. Crew was just like every other flight crew. We took a tape measure and measures the seats front to back and side to side. The seats are the same on all the different airlines we flew except for jet blue which had a 1 inch larger seat. The reason why the seats seem close is because they recline to a greater degree.	1
I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.	0
Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.	0
A3600 14/10/2014 Athens to London and return 22/10/2014 A3603. Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.	0
When I arrived to Brussels airport I had pre-booked my seat a week beforehand. There was a problem with the system and my seat was given away to someone else. I asked then for a window seat and this was not given. I was seated in the centre of the plane in an aisle seat so I had no view of the scenery as we were departing and landing. The cabin crew were friendly. I had pre-booked a hot meal leek and cheddar quiche which was forgotten.	0
Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior. It is a pity.	0
Flew London Heathrow - Athens and back. Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.	0
I flew from Barcelona to Athens and from Athens to Istanbul. I had a booking through United Airlines from Houston originally travelling through Barcelona Athens Istanbul and back to Houston. However at Barcelona Airport I was informed that I had to pay 45 Euro for my baggage for the Aegean flight to Athens. The stewardess were generally rude and spoke little English on board. I will never fly them again.	0
Flight was from Toronto to Dublin. Seats were small and cramped. Drinks took forever to be served and were chargeable (on a transatlantic flight). Crew were very pleasant but there weren't enough of them and service was slow and poor. Food quality was poor - army standards. I am sure there are better airlines doing a better job - WestJet or Air Canada.	0
I travelled business class from Orlando to Dublin. The seats do not recline fully and you are in close proximity to your seatmate. The food is coach class. Do not sit in first row as the attendants go in and out of galley but always fail to close the curtain when they go in and out. Returning to Florida and had to go through JFK and connect to JetBlue who does not have business class so you are in the way back in coach . You can pay extra for a seat closer to the front with extra leg room but of course Aer Lingus does not arrange that. Basically paying for 3/4 business class.	0
Having read favourable reviews of this airline I had been looking forward to my flight from Athens to LHR. The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.	0
MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.	0
Just had a recent experience pre flight. I booked a flight in February for a trip May 21-25 from DFW to PVR. Received an email from my booking site (Rovia) giving me details. From that point to the time of the trip I constantly checked Aeromexico's website for the flight info and it told me that I can't check it until 24 hours before the flight is set to depart. I check it when that time comes and the flight has been rescheduled and conflicted with my connecting flight in Mexico City (both Arrival and departure). This was done without any email notice or anything. There was no attempt to fix the mess up with the exception of giving me a flight in days later and flight out many more days after my trip. This was to be my first trip out of the country and this airline ruined it so I am completely unsatisfied and will definitely recommend anyone doing business with Aeromexico.	0
We flew Aer Lingus for our trip to Europe. We are a family of 4 with extensive travel experience. The tickets were not very cheap to begin with. We wanted to fly into London and fly out of Paris. For this the fare difference between Aer Lingus and Virgin British Airways was about $25-40 per person. Having flown with them I have now decided it would have been better to have flown with BA or Virgin. The flight from SFO to DUB and back is a long haul flight. On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond. From time to time it hangs and we had to ask the crew to reboot the system. I guess we have been used to superior service from BA Singapore Airlines Cathay Air New Zealand and were disappointed even though the difference pricewise was not much. Speaking for myself and family we will not fly Aer Lingus again even if they offer a cheaper price.	0
AM 669 from SFO to Mexico City in Clase Premier / Business Class on January 23 2015. The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing. Aeromexico should be ashamed of themselves for treating their Business Class passengers this way.	0
Buenos Aires to Miami with a delay in the output of Buenos Aires 5hrs. After a scheduled stopover in Santa Cruz in Bolivia suffered a further delay of 4 hours. In addition to this as the plane that took us up was very small for the flight he was forced to make an additional stop to fuel in Cali Colombia. The planes we had to take us to get to Miami were dirty with broken seats no kind of entertainment (such as TV). The poor and inattentive staff of course had to deal with few resources. The return flight similar. Delays old planes but most of the journey by plane Miami-Santa Cruz had a noise in your engine that was intolerable to the ears. Large number of passengers frightened by the strange sound was heard constantly.	0
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil - a saving of about $50US over GOL. At the airport check-in was easy. I recommend that you arrive early to avoid the impending line. The counter staff was as friendly and they did not charge me for my extra luggage weight. I was impressed by the 737 that AeroSur is using on this international flight [do note that most AeroSur flights use aging 727s]. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on this two hours flight and we arrived on time. .	0
I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.	0
"I fly from Bangkok to Copenhagen transit at Moscow then same route on my way back. On my way back to Thailand which is just 2 days ago on SU270 I was not impressed with the cabin crew at all. Their service was not helpful. While they were serving dinner I asked for something to drink the crew member just said ""one minute"". At that time I thought that they were busy serving food so I waited I ended up having to eat my whole meal without any drink! I myself would not fly with this airline again."	0
A3650 ATH-FCO 28th May 2013. One of the crew had a very bad attitude. She never smiled and just dropped the food in front of me in a very rude way without saying anything. Secondly pre-landing I was using an earphone with the music off. She told me to turn it off which I had done. However I still needed to put the earphones on my ear for descent due to discomfort in my ear during that flight. When she saw me still using the earphones she told me again when I said it was already off and she kept telling me in a rude way to turn it off. She refused to check and kept asking me to put down my earphones.	0
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil. At the airport check-in was easy. It pays to arrive early and avoid the impending line. The counter staff was friendly and they did not charge me for my extra weight (about 4 kilos). I was impressed by the new 737 that Aerosur used on this leg - most AeroSur flights use older 727. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on a 2 hours flight and we arrived on time. I would use them again for this route.	0
I bought the ticket in February to travel to Kinshasa in April - in March all flights were cancelled because of the conflict in Libya. I went to the travel agency to ask about what I should do - the answer was to wait until the end of the conflict. Agency was unable to rebook me or to transfer to other airlines. I am having difficulties to find their offices in London or contacts - can someone help. I have lost my money and time and no one to help.	0
Arrived at the airport at 4.30am supposed to fly to Sydney at 8.30am had a connecting flight to Melbourne from Sydney. Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!	0
Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport. I will never fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.	0
"In June 2009 I booked a trip from London to Cape Town (via Tripoli) with Afriqiyah Airways leaving on Christmas day for about £400 - a pretty good deal. However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up ""a few passengers"" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay £200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets. Despite the lovely planes this was the worst airline experience I have had."	0
I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.	0
We bought this ticket to fly from Sao Paulo to Sydney everything went wrong from the beginning. Our flight was delayed 10 hours on the way to Sydney and on the way back they cancelled the flight. After 9 hours we were sent to a hotel near the airport no employee of the Airline anywhere. Bought a new ticket from Lan airlines.	0
Flew Barcelona-Toronto via Dublin. First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.	0
"Today I was scheduled to fly from Mexico City to LAX but I was connecting from another city. Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was ""weather problems"" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost."	0
"LHR-BOS via DUB. They held the flight to DUB in order to fill all unsold seats which made us late for the plane to BOS. They had us run all over the airport 3 times and sent us to 4 different wrong desks staff were rude and patronising they did not listen to anything we said just printed new boarding passes and left us to waste 5 hours in DUB airport with no meal vouchers or anything. Seats were ""downgraded"" to much worse ones in the back plane flight attendance slept for most of the flight and I had to wait 20 mins to get some water to take some headache pills. Even worse on the way back we had to make a transatlantic flight in such a tiny plane that ""low cost airlines"" would have been ashamed of! And all in hellishly hot temperatures."	0
I did some flights with Aigle Azur on Paris - Hassi Messaoud route (Algeria for those who are not familiar). This flight has only one type of customer: oil  gas people. I have found the service as fair overall crew friendliness and meals are actually in good category (crew friendlier then Air France). It's a pity Aigle Azur does not have baggage transfer handling agreement at CDG which means that each time we transit at CDG to / from other airlines we need to go through the immigration to recover our luggage no automatic transfer between Aigle Azur and other airlines at CDG (leading to LOSS of luggage at CDG for those not in the know such as in my case). I hope they could one day operate inside Algeria (the company owner is Algerian - French) since with the local monopoly by Air Algerie the service is non existent.	0
Afriqiyah Airways customer service is non-existent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage - I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.	0
Sydney to Buenos Aires then to Santiago and return. Flying to and from Sydney the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour. Real disappointment for a holiday I had waited 1 year for.	0
A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.	0
On September 7 2013 300 hundred people with small children were kept for 4 hours in Sheremetevo because the aircraft and crew were waiting the group of transit passengers. (Flight SU 0102). It was the difficult long flight to New York - 9.5 hours plus 4 hours delay. Many passengers among these 300 hundred people lost their connections. It is shameful. My seat was between two large men and it was very uncomfortable I had only a half seat for myself. I will avoid Aeroflot flights since this event.	0
ATL-MEX-ATL in addition to my earlier review I want to add the 2nd part of worst experience I had. Redeeming my skymiles I booked ATL-MEX a new ticket as Aeromexico was not willing to rebook me. At the end of my business trip in MEX I tried to check in for my return flight but I learnt that they have an internal policy that if you are not on your first flight they cancel your booking for the second flight. To get home I had to buy another ticket. The SkyTeam should really choose their codeshare partners more wisely. Never again.	0
Dublin to Cardiff on Friday 27 Dec. Stormy day but no information as to when flight would depart. Left waiting in very cold room in bowels of the airport for 2 hours. Flight took off just over 2 hours late but disappointingly pilot never told us they had not taken our baggage due to weight restrictions. At Cardiff everybody stood around the baggage carousel and no bags. Rang Dublin to find out when bags would arrive and found no info. Told case was still in Dublin and as we were due home on Sunday 29th December to go to the baggage counter in arrivals. On Sunday at 1pm I got a call from Cardiff Airport to say my case had arrived and as we were flying home that evening they would hold it at the airport. Like previous comments I like to support The Irish Airline but my confidence in them has been shattered and a good weekend was destroyed.	0
EI 178 Dublin-London. Thoroughly agree with previous reviewer. Lack of information was very frustrating and unhelpful. Despite the delay luggage also did not make it out of Dublin so it is missing somewhere in the world now. Missed transfer to Sydney and no provisions were put in place for those who missed their flights. As an Irish person living abroad who wants to be proud of their national airline I was very disappointed with the experience I had.	0
Mexico City to Cancun in Business Class. Lounge in T2 is ok. Flight attendant wasn't very friendly. Only drinks and no food served on the 2.15 hr flight to Cancun. Very poor service. Seat was ok. No entertainment.	0
My husband and I were so excited for our honeymoon. We left LAX on July 21 2013 destination ZLO. The way there wasn't too bad. On our trip back on Aug 3rd we had a 5 hour layover in Mexico City. Numerous flights were cancelled throughout the day and we ended up staying at the airport for over 12 hours until the cancelled everything altogether. We were put up in a hotel nearby which had a 1.5 hour wait to check in due to everyone else's flight being cancelled. We slept for 2 hours and had our departure to LAX early AM. We finally arrived in LAX and Aeromexico lost my husbands baggage. All we wanted to do was go home and we were stuck waiting for an Aeromexico staff for at least an hour so we could give them our contact information and leave. That was the worst trip back ever.	0
I arrived to the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before my scheduled departure time. I was told that there was a 3 hour mandatory check in time. The agents involved did not want to hear about my issues on my way to the airport. I was told that especially on Sundays flights are full up and my seat was sold to another customer. I had no bags to check in and I had to pay a hefty fine to re-schedule my flight to another day. For all those unfamiliar with the DF airport it takes 10 minutes to go through security and another 5 to walk to the gates. Most flights are not even given a gate number until 1 hour before the scheduled departure time. This was my fist and last time flying with Aeromexico.	0
I have never encountered an airline where the passengers themselves have to collect the luggage from the runway! This happened to me thrice with Air Algerie: Lyon to Constantine 2002 Lyon to Annaba 2004 and Constantine to Paris 2005. I am afraid Air Algerie had a lot to learn to be internationally competent.	0
Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!)	0
"Belfast to Larnaca 18th May at 23.40pm. The food was shocking and the staff rude and unhelpful. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meals unless it was water. The toilet doors at the front were locked and out of order. One lady asked about her booked meal - the air hostess replied ""no booked meals tonight"" shrugged her shoulders and walked on. On the way home however Larnaca to Belfast it was like a different airline - air hostesses were well presented and couldn't do enough but the food was still shocking. On both flights - no film or inflight entertainment."	0
I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !	0
Flight from Bariloche to Buenos Aires delayed 7 hours because of weather. We had a connection from BA to Iguazu that was missed despite airline staff at Bariloche airily dismissing our concerns. Staff did not communicate. The next day we flew to Iguaza with no food or drinks. Staff were hostile uncaring and rude. Planes are old and not very clean.	0
"Miami to EZE. No online check-in or boarding pass. I had one carry on bag and they tried to make me check it. The plane seemed old the food was ok 2 movies on overhead monitors however my headset didn't work. Attendants were friendly hardly ever saw them except for the 2 ""meals"" no diet coke and no soft drinks available for breakfast. Landed 25 minutes late after a 9 hour flight with the announcement ""another on-time arrival"". Saying it doesn't make it so. I have to return on them but I'll not use them again."	0
Istanbul to Moscow on April 13. The airplane was quite old and of poor standard (eg: there is no seat light no visual display to follow the air blows from the seat and not from above). The crew were not well trained their way of addressing customers was not professional. The food they served as a lunch was well below standard.	0
ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!	0
Booked to fly Sydney to BA 1pm Tuesday it's now Friday and I've made it as far as Auckland. We sat all day at the gate in SYD eventually told flight cancelled due to mechanical problem. After spending 2 nights we left SYD last night only to land in Auckland for 16 hour layover due to crew shortages. No communication other than rumours from hotel staff. Airline had paid for accommodation and meals but very basic. No entertainment onboard other. Due to fly out 10pm tonight. Traveller beware.	0
Moscow to Ho Chi Minh City and back last month (15.03 and 30.03). Both flights were drastically delayed (from Moscow to Vietnam 6 hours and back 12.5 hours). I missed all my connecting flights and lost hotel bookings. Unfortunately Aeroflot didn't give any information about estimated boarding or departure times as well as reasons for the delays. No foods or drinks served in Moscow during 5 hours of waiting! My luggage went to Stockholm Arlanda not to Tallinn as it was confirmed in Sheremetjevo Airport. I am home now and got my luggage but I am really not sure if I will use Aeroflot for future trips.	0
6 hours delay from Auckland to Buenos Aires and 5 hours delay from Buenos Aires to Auckland. Food was not good the seats were uncomfortable and the TV system rubbish. Staff were not friendly with little customer service skills.	0
Will never fly with them again. We missed our Aero Mexico flight to LA through their incompetence and consequently our onward connection to Australia that evening. Ground staff were next to useless and we got the run-around for 4 hours being passed from one supervisor to another with no-one wanting to take responsibility with lots of shrugging of shoulders. We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class. Food and service is basic. I believe they have plans to fly from MEX to LHR shortly. They will have to lift their game to be any competition to existing carriers on that route. We love Mexico but will use another airline in the future.	0
Flew Mexico City to New York and back in December 2012. At the time of booking was told that a baby bassinet and baby food would be provided for my infant. When I called to reconfirm the flight 2 days before travel I was told that Aeromexico did not have bassinets on a 5 hour flight from Mex to NY. Felt tricked as I was not given this information at the time of booking. In-flight entertainment non existent no personal video screens and unclean airplane on the way into JFK. Movie was shown on an overhead screen unfortunately the headphones provided were non functional. The food was horrible and neither me nor my wife ate the food no baby food provided for my infant. The only positive from the flight was that the plane was empty and we could place our baby on the seat between us. It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay. Inflight food was terrible no video screens despite the plane being brand new. No baby food for the infant. Again the only positive for the return flight was that the baby had a seat between us as the flight was empty. Overall a bad experience for us and our infant.	0
PEK-FCO return economy class. The PEK-SVO/SVO-PEK legs were served through old planes no IFE uncomfortable seats ok food. Transit through Sheremetyevo Airport was a bit of a nightmare: it took a long time and staff was not friendly and helpful. The SVO-FCO/FCO-SVO were much better as planes were newer IFE available and staff friendlier.	0
"Flew from Madrid to Mexico City. First off my flight was delayed for reasons that none of the staff at the desk was able to explain. Check in was extremely disorganised and poorly signaled. About 1 hour into 14 hour flight I noticed that my inflight entertainment screen was still off while other passengers' screens were on. Then it turned out that 6 rows did not have working inflight entertainment screens or overhead reading lights. As soon as we let the staff know they told us they would ""reset the system"" and let people at the front of the plane know. About 30 minutes later nothing was working and we asked again what the status was. We were told quite rudely that they were looking into it. Needless to say this carried on for another 3 hours. It became evident that the flight attendants were avoiding our section as we could see them walking around offering water to passengers in the aisle on the other side of the plane quite often. Finally about 4.5 hours into the flight the person sitting next to me asked once more whether they'd managed to see what was wrong with our screens. The flight attendant said ""well obviously it's not working. Didn't you figure that out?"". I can understand that technical problems may arise but that does not mean that paying customers should be treated rudely. I was very happy to finally land in Mexico city after 14 hours of a tortuous flight. I am very hesitant to fly with Aeromexico again if this is the standard of customer service that they have."	0
"Flight 109 Dublin to NYC. Scheduled to leave at 3.30pm still in airport at 6.40 - airline says next announcement is at 7.30. They are quick to charge high fees for overweight baggage but they fail to spend the money to maintain a sufficient number of ready to fly planes. Weather is fine and we are still sitting in the airport. It is now 6.55 and we are still sitting here. It is freezing so we asked for a blanket: they said they would ""organize"" one and never provided it."	0
I recently flew from Sharjah to Beirut. The staff were very friendly and I was given 11A an exit seat so I had a lot of leg room though all the seats seemed to have buckets of space (more than my previous LH economy flight). The pay-food was good value and tasty and we landed in Beirut 30 mins early. The attendants came though the cabin twice with free water. The A320 seemed brand new and was very clean. A great Flight.	0
YUL-MEX one way. Aeromexico is the only airline to have a direct flight from Montreal to Mexico City. 5 hours flight very disappointed being the first time flying with them. The aircraft a 737-800 looked very tired and dirty no personal ICE what am I doing here staff food so so at least the cabin was almost empty so I was able to stretch my legs through the flight to not get bored at all. As usual some people are luckier than others in my case it turned not a nice experience. At least we arrived almost on time.	0
Despite booking two tickets together my pregnant wife and I were given separate seats. On a return flight from Madrid to Mexico city. After asking three staff member there was nothing to do according to them. On board we had asked for special food and again no sign of it. On the way back we called in advance to have a front row seat and staff at the telephone were helpful but while checking in at the airport we found ourselves in a back seat. Again the special meal was nowhere to be seen. In the future I will try to avoid using this company.	0
I fly regularly on the flight Almaty to Beijing and back. I have to say this is a terrible flight. 4-5 hours at night on an A320. There is little difference between business and economy. The support service for booking and upgrades is simply the worst I have experienced.	0
BHD to LHR. Flight on time flew on a modern A319 cabin crew friendly enough however legroom was practically non existant I literally didn't have room to read a magazine on my lap and actually getting to my (window) seat was tough. Overall pretty average but the lack of reasonable legroom made the flight quite uncomfortable.	0
MEX-LAX Dec 2011. Business/First poor boarding seat cramped meal was a bad ham sandwich. Plane was a 737-700 that was late departing. As we approached LAX there was fog and we were told we were going to Tijuana. On arrival at Tijuana passengers told we would be flown back to Mexico City. As a few passengers complained we were eventually let off the plane but told we were 'on our own'. Airline did not care less and said they had no responsibility for the situation. Bags took 30 minutes to show up. The product was bad to start with but the whole experience was just awful. Ended up taking a taxi to San Diego and then having to drive myself to LA.	0
SFO-OAX roundtrip via MEX. Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner. Only highlight of flying AM was that we ended up spending a lot of time at the Salon Premier lounges in T2 which were nice though filled to the gills.	0
LHR-SVO-ULN return. I have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months. This is by far the fastest way to Mongolia from London but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through SVO. The planes from LHR to SVO are generally new and clean. Onward from Moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. The food is always the same - just about edible in business class. Out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. Going to give up with Aeroflot and fly Korean air via Seoul now. Via Moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while.	0
Flight was cancelled from Sydney to Auckland on July 28. I knew this as had checked on internet. However when I tried to ring I got cut off 4 times before finally talking to someone. When we finally got to the airport the boy I was travelling with was 'on the list' but I wasn't and was touch an go as to whether I would get a flight at all. All ended well as we finally both got back to NZ even though we were put on different flights. I felt sorry for the staff in Sydney understaffed and under a lot of stress but they were polite and as helpful as possible.	0
Traveled with Aer lingus in May 2013 from London to Belfast City. Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia. These aircraft are only just bearable for a shorter journey. I also found there to be too many in flight announcements selling food and goods. British Airways is the alternate option on this route and whilst their punctuality is not as good as Aer Lingus - every other feature is.	0
CDG-RUN-CDG in Club Austral (Business) class. October - November 2006. Quick check-in nice lounges (although poor drink and snack selections) at both CDG and RUN. All flights perfectly on time quick delivery of luggage on arrival. Business class seat comfort (old) business class IFE (not on demand) first class service and meals. Overall a very nice product much cheaper than Air France and much better (at least compared to AF current B747 on this route ; new AF product using B777 is expected in 2007). Minor drawbacks : frequent flyer program does not seem on par with AF one ; CDG airport is further from Paris than ORY (which AF uses).	0
During our holiday in Argentina we were unlucky to have several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. They are by far the worst airline I have experienced. It is a very poorly run state owned airline acting like a monopolist. Customers are treated like dirt. Staff at check in is rude (Puerto Iguazu was the only exception). Flights are nearly always delayed without any explanation given or sometimes cancelled altogether. Even worse some of its planes are in very poor condition and seem utterly unsafe. Follow the advice of some Argentinians I met : always avoid them. It is better to spend 24 hours in a bus (they are very comfortable) than 2 hours with Aerolineas.	0
The food was basic but acceptable. Astonished by rudeness of the cabin crew no service at all we were not greeted on the aircraft or off. Crew ignored our need for a glass of water my seat was broken no film or music for a 4 hour flight.	0
"Aeroparque-Montevideo return  4 people at the check-in 2 of them working. The rest doing everything to avoid the customer. Although arriving 2h before departure we almost missed our flight. The queue became so long that locals started fighting with the personnel since they lost their flights due to Aerolineas Argentinas ""I dont care attitude"". Service onboard is a plastic bag with juice and a fruit-bar. Flight attendants friendly. A country like Argentina does deserve a better airline."	0
All planes were hot and stuffy. But their customer service is completely ridiculous. We had 2 checked bags going from Mexico City to Seattle they lost one of them. We reported it missing and then called the next day and they said they had no report and couldn't find the package. They gave us numbers to phones where no one would answer and were completely apathetic. Once they finally found the luggage they then shipped it 5 hours away from our home instead of to the Portland airport which is 15 minutes away. Then they lost the baggage in Yakima! Turns out they shipped it to Canada - still working on getting it back.	0
Booked to fly to Dublin from Birmingham on 18th April on the 14.50 flight. This flight was delayed 5 hours we had no information of any kind during this time. It was not until we got on board and the pilot explained what happened this is very bad practice. It would have been very helpful if we had an announcement just to explain why the plane was late and giving an estimated time of departure. As a result I missed my bus connection and my relatives had to come up to the airport to collect me at 8.30pm.	0
Something is going wrong with this previously reasonable airline. Almaty - Astana flights. The basic route for this airline are notoriously delayed. So if you plan on a business trip on this route make sure to factor in at least a fee hours. Better a day. Disappointing. Ground staff not trained on how to deal with this. As a result they are nervous not pleasant and generally not helpful at all.	0
"March 20th 2015. Flight 7001 from Miami International to Rome via Dusseldorf. The boarding started around 3.15pm. After several hours inside the plane we were informed by the captain that they were trying to fix a ""leak"". After two more hours we were instructed to disembark the aircraft with our carry on and wait inside the terminal. Neither water or any type of food or snacks were offered by Air Berlin employees. Early evening we were told to board the aircraft again with all our belongings to our incredible surprise we stayed inside the plane again for more than two hours. Finally the captain informed the passengers that now the aircraft was having computer ""issues"" and we would have to sleep in Miami without any hint as to when the next plane will be ready for us to continue to Dusseldorf. Early next morning I went to Air Berlin counter just to find chaos and indifference to all passengers from the day before. The employees did not know when the next plane will be departing so I run to American Airlines who provided me with connections to Rome."	0
Flight from London to Delhi via Moscow was cancelled on the day of departure. They put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in Moscow rather than a 3 hour one. I requested a Vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. No one at Aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didn't carry any vegetarian meals. I received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice. These two meagre items not only came to more than the amount I had in tokens but required me to pay several Euros too! The level of English of Aeroflot staff is terrible for an international airline.	0
Traveled from Boston to Dublin an 18 December 2012. Flight was very crowded. Lost of crying babies. They didn't turn the lights off all night and it was very uncomfortable. Flight attendants were rude but I guess they were just busy. Difficult to get any service. Miserable trip.	0
"Long delay in departing Almaty bound for KL. Perfect weather although no real excuse given. On boarding more than 2 hours late and by bus from the terminal to the aircraft which caused more delay we sat on the ground for a further 30 mins while a drunken passenger was off-loaded. At least half the flights I have taken with Air Astana have been delayed by hours not just minutes. On-board I asked the cabin crew to see if the connecting flight would be held or if other arrangements needed to be made. Their reply was that 'we will call ground staff and let you know'. The second time was 'we will talk to the captain' the third time was the same answer. On my fourth request I was then told that we have other passengers who are all going to be late. I was travelling on an Air Astana ticket and there was no concern or accountability shown toward this situation. T Arriving in KL with just 10 minutes to spare for the connection on Malaysia Airlines of course we could not board. 767 used on this route is very old although has had some face-lifts. Seats are narrow for business class seats and they are not lay flat they are ""lay on an angle and keep sliding down"" seats. The entertainment system is an IPAD style of portable unit. This only had a choice of three last release movies and at the end of the day there is nowhere to put it where you might consider ergonomically sensible to watch it. I would recommend that you definitely leave a minimum of 5 hours for your connections because they will most likely be late!"	0
LED-SVO. During this one hour journey the crew managed to serve newspapers drinks (with coffee/tea) plus a nice sandwich. New A320 everything went smoothly. Recommend on this busy route between 2 Russian main cities.	0
LHR-Moscow. On arrival asked if possible to have an exit row seat. Was advised of a €45 charge which was then waived which was a nice start. Aircraft then boarded one hour late and one hour taxi/waiting to take off which made it 2 hrs delayed. Cabin crew efficient but poor command of English. Good leg room/comfort with food as expected on an Economy ticket although alcohol has to be paid for.	0
Istanbul-Moscow-Tokyo (Narita) Economy. Was not expecting much when I purchased the cheapest one way ticket I could find. Check-in at Istanbul despite having a 20 mins wait was friendly and easy. Flight to Moscow delayed 30 mins but the cabin interior was clean and brand new if a bit spartan (no inflight entertainment). Still the seats were comfy and the flight attendants courteous. Moscow-Tokyo leg was great. The seats were comfortable flight attendants friendly and everything went smoothly. My only real complaint is that the choices on the inflight entertainment on this leg were slim but at least it was there.	0
JNB-GBE-JNB. Pleasantly surprised with the flights on ATR's considering we were in the middle of RTW FC Oneworld - unfair comparison. Cabin crew were OK certainly as good as I would expect. The aircraft must have had new paint recently as they looked quite good in and out. Didn't expect to be flying them no spare pages in passport so SA wouldn't allow me in country.	0
Johannesburg - Maun Economy Clas BAe-146. On arrival at the airport we engaged the services of a porter. We had 2 rucksacks and 2 camera bags. I paid him around ZAR30 (USD4) and it was well worth it. As we had bought goods in Johannesburg and wanted to claim back tax I told the porter and he zipped us off to a Customs Counter that had no queue (we passed others that had at least 7 people waiting in line). We cleared Customs in no time check in was fast immigration and security had short queues and it took around 15 minutes to get the VAT refund processed. The aircraft was a BAe-146 - load was around 30% so we had 3 seats to ourselves. We were served a drink and a very small sweet roll. Maun airport is a small building with 1 immigration line and a bench where your bags get delivered to. Customs a breeze.	0
Air Berlin takes low cost to the max - we will never fly with them again. 3 of us flew from Heraklion to JFK via Dusseldorf on July 20th. After checking in online the previous evening we arrived at Heraklion airport 2 hours early to drop off our bags. There was no separate bag drop line and we were at the very back of the check in line. AB was trying to check in 350 passengers for 2 flights using only 2 counters Each group would take 10-15 min to be checked in - a total nightmare. By the time we got to the counter it was 10 min past departure time the PA system was calling our names for boarding and we hadn't even started the check-in process. By some miracle we made it onto the plane but our bags didn't. When we got to JFK we filled out the lost bag paperwork and headed home thinking we'd get the bags in a day or two. We finally got 1 bag 5 days later and the other two 8 days later.	0
Amsterdam to Atyrau return – one of the most expensive flights per mile of any routes worldwide by any operator so you might think the flight would be special. Old aircraft substandard in-flight entertainment (the overhead TV monitor in my section not working and others with poor picture from what I could see) cramped full flight 2 of the 3 meal choices not available by the time the meal cart got to me all the wine with the meals gone by half way down the cabin bar service once per flight and grudgingly given using cheap local (to Kazakhstan) versions of spirits mixers and wines by unsmiling cabin crew.	0
Delhi-Barcelona. I could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled. My connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation. Moscow airport contains narrow corridors with duty free shops food must be paid with Russian money. There was free Internet but only in a few places with low wifi signal. Plane food was bland and mediocre. Average service.	0
Gaborone to Johannesburg. Not too bad at all. The Pula lounge in Gaborone although tiny is quite a comfortable spot to relax in before the flight. The ATR42 operated on the route is definitely showing its age and seats are fairly uncomfortable. Snack service consists of peanuts and biltong whereas competitor SA Express provides a full sandwich service on board. Crew were friendly - downside being arrival in Johannesburg - for aircraft to overnight in Johannesburg we were parked on a remote stand a good 10-15 minutes from the terminal building.	0
Flying Air Berlin OLB-TXL. Plane in a good condition and clean. Cabin attendants however very unpleasant and seemed just to wait to finish the job. Sandwich with cheese of very bad quality. Hope not to be in situation to fly them again.	0
Hamburg to Tashkent via Moscow and not impressed with Aeroflot. Plane interior was old and not very clean. Entertainment not existing on both flights. Inflight magazine only in Russian. Food was tasteless and choice of drinks is very limited (one drink on 3-4 hour flight and only choice between orange and tomato-juice and Cola or sprite. No alcoholic drinks served or sold. All in all a very disappointing experience!	0
The service at SVO airport is horrible. I flew to Copenhagen by SAS flight 8700 operated by Aeroflot. The agent wanted to charge me for the excess baggage. I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized. In fact all the personnel there turned out to be so rude and incompetent.	0
This airline made a lot of improvements : new aircraft good crew hot meals - no problem at all during flight.	0
At Beijing we had about 2 hours of delay boarding an aged B767. After another 45 minutes captain said sorry today we do not fly: the plane is broken. By about 0430 in the morning the Aeroflot airport staff said to me that I must spend my night with an unknown other traveller. After having been sent to the miserable hotel at about 1330 next day I was able to leave Beijing to Moscow with a better A332 aircraft. Staff is incompetent and very rude. They just don't know a word of English and if you have a problem it remain a your problem. They have to learn a lot.	0
Kiev-Moscow-JFK. Experienced more of the same disorganization that I saw on my previous flights. I have found that flight attendants to not enforce the rules because they are half the size of their very pushy customers. Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers. Aeroflot tickets are cheap enough to entice me to fly with them again even if the passengers act like a mob.	0
London-Moscow-Bangkok price way cheaper than competitors when we booked planes seemed pretty new decent choice of films music games etc so-so - food. Staff extremely unfriendly no alcohol in economy 3 hours in Moscow. Would always have to be way cheaper than better alternatives such as Thai Etihad Emirates for me to use them again. However much better than Royal Jordanian who we used to BKK last Christmas - they were truly appalling.	0
After a long trip from Sydney-Abu Dhabi and a stop time of 3 hours (+1/2 hour delay) the more than 7 hours flight to Dusseldorf started. After almost 2 hours flying finally the staff offered us a small sandwich (with beef or cheese) and one cup of coffee. Another 2 hours later we got a bottle of water. Doing nothing but trying to sit compressed between my seat and the extreme tilted seat in front of me I really felt hungry. When I asked for another piece of bread I got one and the promise that there would be more served in 20 minutes. Indeed we got food. While collecting the rubbish we were offered a drink coffee? No only cold drinks. Before my experiences with Air Berlin were ok but this last flight was really unpleasant.	0
"My boyfriend and I book a trip to Dublin only to get to the airport and was told the flight was cancelled. The manager said the next flight was the following day at 9.45pm. When passengers started asking to be put on another flight he said there were too many of us he said there was nothing he could do and finally shouted ""I am not going to answer anymore questions the flight is cancelled and that is that"". We cancelled the flight and booked another airline that same day."	0
"For an almost 2 hours flight to Bucharest from Berlin TXL we we're served a 20g pack of potato chips which was described as snack. Every airBerlin flight the ""snacks"" become smaller and smaller but this is too much. That bag of potato chips will cost anywhere less than 1 Euro and I think this becomes towards a customer humiliating. There are always the same unhappy stewardess-faces always looking like they can't wait to finish their shift and go home. Not to mention that at the airport we were sent in an improved Terminal with only two flights very crowded and absolutely no duty free facilities. I am fed up with this airline and I have given up my topbonus card after one year of bad experiences with them. I hope I will never have to travel again with them. The only plus I can give the flight was in time."	0
Wasn't the worst flight I've been on, I'll say that. But when you arrive 2 hours early and your flight gets delayed and you arrive at your destination and they not only forget to put my checked luggage on the plane but half a dozen other peoples luggage on the same flight might I add, is just plain ridiculous! Yes I understand it happens, but not to eight different people on the same flight. I fly a lot and out of all the airlines I fly, this has been the most disappointing! My boyfriend and I checked our bags at the same time and his bag arrived.	0
28th August 2013 from Malaga to Hamburg on a very well maintained 737-800. Journey started with online check-in and a bag drop at Malaga airport. The queue was not orderly and the staff did not police the queue very well at all. The check-in agent who dealt with me seemed indifferent and did not make eye contact with me which was rather rude. Boarding the flight took quite a long time as the flight was full. Far too much hand luggage had been allowed aboard the flight. The cabin crew were not very friendly nor welcoming at all. There was considerable turbulence during this flight and the crew did little to allay the fears and concerns of some of the passengers. A small snack was served as well as a drink. At the end of the flight an overheard monitor displayed the route taken for a few minutes only. There was no goodbye from the crew at the end of the flight. I found the staff very cold on this occasion.	0
As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America. There is nothing left that distinguishes them from their American counterparts. Time to get your act together AC.	0
Air Canada rouge was a disgrace at least on this flight. The aircraft interior was dirty, seats shabby and the state of the toilet was atrocious. The aircraft had been at the gate for long enough to be properly cleaned, so there was no excuse for the lack of cleanliness. Flight attendants completely indifferent throughout the flight. Clearly they were intent on doing the bare minimum. Surely and unsmiling. Very poor standard of grooming, some looked like they had slept in their uniforms. There is no in seat entertainment system. A long flight on Air Canada Rouge would be unbearable. Avoid at all costs.	0
ORD-Dublin return. Very disappointing experience. On the way to Dublin the flight was nowhere near full but when asked if we could book seats together it was deemed an inconvenience. The flight attendants are not attentive and are inconvenienced if you ask to be served anything other than tea or coffee. The gate personnel on this airline were unwilling to make any accommodations. On the return gate check-in personnel were awful. They were unnecessarily stern and would not bend to make a single accommodation.	0
Done all necessary procedure to make sure my girl would get proper assistance as she has special needs. When she got to Toronto, no wheelchair was brought to her even though AC confirmed that she would have her own at the door for the leg at the next terminal. She had to walk to the gate and no one offered help! She has cerebral palsy and walks with difficulty and very slowly. Nobody at AC wondered if the only passenger with a wheelchair had the proper service.	0
Departing Catania Sicily Italy on June 30th we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before scheduled departure time. Massive line for check-in only one woman and one desk checking in 2 flights. No weather nor equipment issue purely bad management and under-staffing. 3 hours in line not a single announcement. By the time we arrived in Dusseldorf our flight (business class) to JFK was long gone. Told the next flight they could get us to Chicago on was the following afternoon - 24 hours later! Told they'd booked us into the airport hotel and they gave us two 10 Euro food vouchers. Flew back to Chicago on Lufthansa/the Star Alliance. Despite business-class having angled seats the food service and punctuality of the flight were flawless. As a lifetime-gold/million-miler on American this experience was sufficient for me to alter my habits and to focus on the Star for my future air- travel needs. Air Berlin's 'service' was utterly lacking.	0
I frequently visit Las Vegas throughout the year, I thought I would give Air Canada Rouge a try. One major problem was that the day I flew there was a fuel service strike so I was delayed for over 4 hours. I frequently check my flight status especially when I leave, throughout that day I had checked at least 4 times. I only found out about it when I was at the check in counter. There was no email, no automated phone call, nothing to notify me. I was stuck waiting for hours doing nothing. When we finally got on the flight all they said was sorry. Nothing more. Not even some form of a minor compensation like refunding the baggage fee or something free on the flight. The seats were cramped, there was significantly less legroom compared to Westjet. No entertainment system whatsoever. It's 2015 and this airline operates like it's 1990 with the design of this plane. The sad part is that they can get away with this because there's absolutely no competition in this industry within Canada. Flight travel should be a stress free situation and the whole time I used this airline was such a inconvenience.	0
I've flown transatlantic on Air Canada twice this year, both less then ideal experiences. For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.	0
I have traveled to Europe many times. This was the worst flight I have been on. The seats were extremely cramped and uncomfortable on an 11 hour flight. The person behind me had their knee in the small of my back. Wine was extra. Service lousy. Entertainment via wifi to your personal tablet with ten year old movies. I got told I couldn't get a extra cup of coffee because we were within an hour of landing.	0
June 16 2013 Venice to Dusseldorf to JFK. Very unorganized in Venice. First told to wait in line 54/55 then it was moved to 5657. There was not enough staff to check us in and people in line were rude and pushy. When we finally boarded we were taken to a bus that they crammed the entire plane into. A mad rush to board. The crew opened both doors which made no sense so again another round of people pushing and ending up on the wrong end of the plane. After everyone was settled we were told that the plane had to be mechanically signed off so had to wait 30 minutes or so. The flight from Dusseldorf to JFK had to be held for us. Impressed with Air Berlin on our outbound flight June 5 from JFK to Dusseldorf to Barcelona but this return flight home left much to be desired.	0
Miami-Berlin. Took flight on a one way basis as return dates were subject to change. I am a top tier AA flier and the addition to Air Berlin gives some good connection options. Aircraft was a new Airbus with standard seat pitch and seat comfort in economy was uncomfortable. The IFE is good with each seat having independent controls and a reasonable selection of movies etc. Unfortunately the selection is via a touch screen buried in your seat back and the Neanderthal behind me felt that instead of lightly touching the screen they had to indent their finger into the screen - constant tap tap into my seat that precluded any chance of sleep. Food average drinks average FA's average. Despite being top tier no way to select seat on line - had to call in advance and their website is poor.	0
"New York to Dusseldorf Koln to Berlin Munich to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to New York in the last 2 weeks. Flights were late which seems out of character for a German airline but landed on time. The seats are extremely close together. I'm 6'4"" (194 cm) and could not sit with my legs forward at all and could not stretch them under the seat either. For the longer flights the entire 8 hour flights my knees and shins were pressed into some part of the seats in front of me. I was on the aisle so every time someone passed by me they bumped my knee shoulder or foot impossible to even relax much less sleep. I'm not overweight at all but these seats could only be comfortable for children. To make it all worse on the trans-oceanic flights the pilots seemed to find every segment of turbulence over the North Atlantic. I think we were bouncing around for at least 50% of the trip. Air Berlin: good prices bad passenger experience."	0
LHR to Phuket. We were worried about travelling with this airline following the reviews on here however our flight to Phuket was on time and food and in flight entertainment was ok. So far so good. Our return journey was a different story. We arrived at Phuket airport to be told we couldn't check in as the AirBerlin plane hadn't arrived or even set off for us. Various options were thrown around including another night in Phuket returning on the next Airberlin flight. After being left in the dark for some time we were then booked on to a Qatar airlines flight which first flew to Kuala Lumpur then to Qatar where we then boarded a flight to Heathrow. In total we were delayed by 8 hours. The manner in which we were left in the dark at Phuket was very worrying and it seems from the reviews below that this is not rare for this airline.	0
Trip from Abu Dhabi to Phuket. The plane is new the overall look is ok entertainment is ok as well (just a few movies and all in English and German). But leg room is ridiculously small the seats are very hard and the food is just ok. Adding to this a very unpleasant crew. I will avoid flying Air Berlin on long distances in the future.	0
"Three flights on Air Canada: first flight was YYJ-YYC - a Bombardier Q400 Propeller Plane. It was surprisingly quiet and smooth for a propeller plane as I sat as far away as possible from the engines at the very last row. Cabin crew acceptable but no food offered on this flight. Next leg: YYC-FRA on an Airbus 330 - cabin crew on this flight were atrocious. Food was literally thrown on passengers tray tables. Serving portions were very small. The food which was offered was disgusting - the tomato pasta dish was extremely unappetizing. And the ""continental breakfast"" was a small piece of cake and a yoghurt shake - it was hardly a snack let alone a breakfast. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal service not to be seen again until before landing in FRA. Final leg: YYZ to YYJ onboard an Airbus 320. Seats uncomfortable - my neck became sore about an hour or so into the flight. Again no complimentary food offered on this five and a half hour flight. Overall Air Canada never ceases to disappoint."	0
LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.	0
We had a May 10 premium economy booking from Athens to Toronto at 13.00 in the afternoon. At 9.30 that morning we received a cryptic message from Air Canada apologizing for the flight disruption. We telephoned Toronto to find out that in actuality it had been cancelled due to 'overcrowded airspace'. We were fortunate enough after two phone calls to be able to rebook through London. It was simply listed as 'delayed' and as we boarded outer London flight at 1.30 it was still listed this way. They were as it tip urns out eventually rolled over to the next day 13.00 flight. This is not right not to have informed us all about the flight being cancelled. I do not think I will attempt a Rouge flight again.	0
Booked XL seats on the flight from Tegel-Miami but the seats was not XL. They were by the door (entrance door and emergency exit) which has a very big bulge on the door with makes the legroom (for your left leg) smaller than an ordinary seat. I asked the steward about this and he was somewhat surprised that the seat was sold as XL. On the way back we ordered XL seat for my son. He got an ordinary seat. On the way back we also booked reserved seating for me and my wife to make sure we did not get bad seats. We got seats by the toilet which were impossible to recline. All together we have paid about 200 euro for nothing.	0
"JFK-TXL-CPH and CPH-DUS-JFK. Inadequate legroom for a 5'9"" tall person meant my knees touched the seat in front of me on the overnight to Berlin from JFK. On the way back from Dusseldorf a 6'1"" guy sitting next to me couldn't fit in his seat without sitting bowlegged and the elderly woman in front of him couldn't recline. Aside from the DUS-JFK meals which included various unidentifiable items and cold chicken nuggets other amenities were fine but I will never fly them long haul again. On a positive note domestic European transfers had more legroom than the transatlantic flights."	0
Flight got cancelled and still waiting refund from this airline (4 weeks waiting without even a short answer). Customer Care-Center hasn't got a telephone number or E-Mail given on their website -small print out was the only thing we got at the airport no alternative flight or anything like that. You better pray that your flight experiences no problems or you're probably as lost as I am.	0
Woke up at 4 am to a crying 21 yr old study abroad daughter who had a flight cancelled from Rome to Dublin - Aer Lingus desk information personnel did not notify my daughter that they would rebook her trip for the next day - she in turn spent an additional $1100.00 to try to get home. She is currently in a hotel (still in Rome) and was told there would be no other compensation. She'll be flying back Alitalia.	0
Flew Las Vegas to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to SFO. AirBerlin has chosen to cram as many seats as possible on the plane an Airbus A330-200 reducing the seat pitch in economy to 30 inches. To do this they removed all padding in the back of the seat and space for legs. Nearly the least comfortable seats I have ever been in and certainly the worst for an 11 hour flight. Lots of empty seats on the plane an indication of how attractive the airline is. The flight out of Las Vegas was 2 hours late in leaving; there is no online check-in for Germany-USA flights the counters do not open until 3 hours before the flight so you drag luggage around until they do open. The cabin was cold not merely cool. Otherwise the food was tolerable the drink cart did have free wine and Baileys the new - not on all flights - On-Demand entertainment system with seat back screens did have an OK selection of movies CDs TV programs; and the staff was efficient and polite. If AirBerlin in the future will get me a direct flight over a painful series of connections I would take them again - otherwise there is another German airline.	0
My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.	0
Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding. First and last time to fly AC - an airline who are really let down by the worst flight attendants I have seen.	0
"Booked to fly DCA to Quebec City via Ottawa Feb 13 leaving 7 am arriving 10.30 am. Instead after ""crew rest"" issues delayed the first flight ended up doing: DCA to Toronto where we missed our next connection due to delayed flight; and then the next flight was cancelled (no snow that day) and after much negotiation with bored reps (and a 1 hour hold with customer service) we ended up Toronto to Montreal where we were promised we could get to Quebec City but when we arrived they couldn't book us for 48 more hours to Quebec. Ended up renting a car in Montreal and driving to Quebec City where our bags were lost for another day. 3 hour process turned into 24 hours and we never arrived at our destination via Air Canada. Were promised flights that didn't exist no apologies. Never again."	0
I have been Super Elite on Air Canada for many years but this now comes to an end. The change to Rouge service for popular destinations from Vancouver is the reason. I cannot fit in the economy despite being slim and fit. My legs don't fit!. I flew the business class and it was disgusting. Terrible food and kids providing service. I have switched to Alaska and West Jet as a result. I will also note that the new business class seats on Air Canada long haul service are the worst I have ever experienced. There is no room to extend your legs and the tray is impossible to figure out.	0
"I flew from YVR-HNL on March 6th and was assigned the one lonely seat right at the back of the plane in row 51. I asked the gate agent politely if there was any chance he could move me up. He was helpful and moved me up to Row 21 where there was an empty seat. The in-flight entertainment was ok for the 6+ hours flight enough to get me there (because I can't sleep on planes.) I was also starving halfway through the flight but wasn't interested in pay $13.50 for a wrap so shelled out the $4.50 for pretzels and hummus as there was no free snack offered to go with my Diet pop. My flight from HNL-YVR was cancelled. I had checked in online already but when I got to the airport (2 hours before take off) I noticed the lines at the ticket booths were not moving at all and there was an already overall miserable feeling mulling about between the guests. I overheard someone say the flight was cancelled. I never even received a notification regarding this fact until it was close to boarding time. There were already guests checked through bags checked and they were told to come back through security to the ticket booths so they could be assigned a hotel to stay at overnight. Our aircraft never showed up due to ""mechanical problems"". It wouldn't be departing until the following day at 1.30pm. All connecting flights in Vancouver to my final destination (Winnipeg) would've already been long gone so I would've been stuck with an overnight in Vancouver the following night. I was flying alone however the rest of my family was on a WestJet flight scheduled to leave 15 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off. I asked the lady at the ticket counter what my options were and if she'd be able to help get on the WestJet flight instead. She kept blowing me off telling me there was nothing she could do nor did she seem like she was willing to help me in anyway. The lady at the Westjet counter immediately took all information and got me on the flight with no problems. Needless to say Air Canada Rouge definitely disappointed me big time. No wonder the flight was ridiculously cheap!"	0
In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.	0
LHR to YYZ on 12 Dec. The flight was 4.5 hours late food was awful and then to top it off my luggage was left behind at LHR. Return trip was just as awful with the standard cramped seats and to top it off they messed up my meal (dietary requirements) not once but twice. The meal was given to the wrong passenger and when I spoke to the flight attendant all I got was an apology that they did not have anything else to offer. Then they repeat the mistake again during snack time. If it weren't for the virtual monopoly on the LHR-YYZ I would not be travelling with AC ever again.	0
Air Canada continually disappoints. Their loyalty program is worthless unless you want to cash in your points for a flight with 3 connections and even then you still have to pay $500 in taxes and fees along with your points. Flew to Jamaica on AC Rouge as part of a vacation package. Worst plane ever nice flight attendants that had to deal with the airlines inability to properly stock food and beverage (they ran out of everything about a half way through the service so half the plane had nothing to eat). Both outgoing and return flights were an hour late in arriving. Other than some of their non Rouge planes being nice and the entertainment in those planes being pretty solid there is not much good to say about this overpriced airline and their ability to deliver flights on time and in a satisfactory manner.	0
Staff unfriendly and impolite they were eating during our conversation at the front desk. I had a flight from London Stansted to Verona they cancelled it without informing me because I booked trough Edreams. I had been waiting for 5 hours at the airport no information displayed no apology and I had to pay the transport from Stansted to Gatwick. I tried to complain with the customer service via email but no reply at all.	0
First time flying Toronto to Jamaica with Air Canada rouge and never again will I fly AC Rouge. I will be cancelling my Visa Aeroplan and start using Adventura. The seats were so uncomfortable I had to roll-up my husbands sweater and stuff it behind my lower back. Having to use tablets to view movies etc is a real pain. Trying to eat and view / hold your tablet is difficult. Plus the TV shows are old and movies are old as well. Low budget airline at no discounted cost.	0
"Quite simply the worst ""business class"" cabin I have ever had the misfortune of traveling in. ""Premium"" class seats on Air Canada Rouge are the exact same size as economy class seats. Flight was one hour late and not properly groomed in between flights. Lots of garbage left on plane. Also heard a couple of elderly people complain at the gate that no pre-boarding was being offered. Once airborne service was non-existent. No meal offered on a 5 hour international flight? Again this is supposed to be ""premium"" class. No blankets. Cabin was freezing. No seat back entertainment iPads were offered that were glitchy and the flight attendant seemed annoyed when I asked for ear buds. I could go on and on. Just a total disaster every step of the way. Air Canada is my airline of choice but avoid Rouge at all costs. I usually only give reviews to companies when it's something positive and the service was remarkable. But Rouge is just remarkably bad. One star."	0
Travelled on flight AC034 Sydney to Vancouver on October 14 the staff were not very friendly or happy. Moving around or using the bathroom was very difficult as the seat belt signs were kept on for most of the flight even when the conditions weren't turbulent. Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful.	0
London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.	0
Berlin to Cologne. We left 90 mins late so arrived 90 mins late. But what made me angry most was the missing empathy of the unfriendly crew for the passengers who had to wait 1.5 hrs in the dry-air cabin without any offers of water to drink.	0
Second time flying Rouge. Air Canada should take their name off of this disaster of a discount carrier as it will kill their overall reputation. Our first trip was with our 2 year old to Florida. Flight was delayed 7 hours with no information as to why. When we got to Orlando we had to wait an addition 3 hours for our bags. This flight is to Cancun. Was supposed to leave at 10 am finally left at 7.30pm. Again no reasons given. Flight was packed and seats were cramped. I could go on and on about all the negatives but Rouge is a disaster. I have always liked Air Canada but Rouge has killed all the goodwill Air Canada had built up with me over the years.	0
YYC to YXE. I politely asked the check in personal at Calgary a basic question about baggage fees and received a very defensive rude response. Customer service does not appear to be much of a priority. Flight attendant was not particularly friendly and had minimal interaction with passengers. I find the overall experience much more efficient on Westjet and they're fleet is newer too.	0
"We were booked home in January 2015 on an Air Canada Rouge flight and charged full points by Aeroplan as per the normal Business Class on Air Canada flights. I do not know how Air Canada can pass off this ""Business Class"" on their Rouge flight as equal to their normal Business Class accommodation which they offer. Clearly I questioned the Aeroplan representative when told we would fly home on Rouge and was told it is the same as regular Air Canada Business Class although not the pods but with adequate comfort and leg room. To say that the seating was inadequate would be an understatement. We have traveled Air Canada Business Class annually YVR to OGG and have never encountered such sub-standard cramped seating with minimal leg room. My husband and I are tall people this being one of the reasons we choose Business or Executive Class. I was barely able to walk when we finally landed in Vancouver. This type of accommodation can cause a health issue for many people. You charge for Executive Class and provide less than adequate Economy seating. Since 2004 we have travelled to Maui annually and paid the extra Aeroplan points for the comfort of the Business Class. In our estimation we got less than Economy. Most of the Canadians whom we encountered on Maui who had flown Air Canada Rouge Business Class were horrified and the reports we received were of great concern to us. Even though we had been privy to these negative comments we felt that being Air Canada it could not be that unsatisfactory. Therefore based on past experience we embarked upon this flight with open minds. We were quite incorrect it was far worse than anything we could have imagined. This is gross misrepresentation on the part of Aeroplan and Air Canada. If Rouge is the only flight Air Canada is offering between Vancouver and the Hawaiian islands then we will be seeking flights with other airlines in the future. At best it was ""Cattle Class"" accommodation. I can only imagine the cramped conditions for the people in Economy."	0
Flew from Vancouver to Phoenix - had no idea how uncomfortable the seats were when I booked the flight otherwise would have chosen a different airline. I have some hip/sciatica issues and suffered for days after. Will not fly on Rouge ever again.	0
Air Canada have either revamped or replaced their 777s and they are now 3x4x3. I was stuck with a large woman next to me a seat leg directly in front of where my feet needed to go and the leg had an entertainment control box on either side of it in effect requiring me to have no legs as there was nowhere to put my feet. If I had been a 6 foot+ man I would have been miserable. The new leather seats are harder than the old ones and are very uncomfortable. The screen can no longer be angled. The service was the one thing which has not changed it was as dreadful as it has always been. We will after 25 years of flying with AC be looking for a new carrier. The two 9 hour+ flights were pure misery.	0
Checking in on our flight from Toronto to Copenhagen our pre-booked window seats had been taken by another reservation agent. Despite written confirmation stating our seat selection my travel companion and I had to sit three rows apart in seats D and F.	0
Dusseldorf-Bangkok return. Check in at Dusseldorf airport took a long time. Staff is unfriendly and not much service or help at check in. One customer before me had a problem with small overweight handbag. Staff just shouted at him. No window seats available although later in the airplane there were empty seats occupied by staff. Food poor. On my return from Chiang Mai transit was poorly coordinated by Air Berlin. Only by help through Thai Airways was I able to find transit point and catch my flight in time. Air Berlin also forget at first to file my correct passport number - had to return at check in. Flight back horrible - no window seats just small seat in the middle. Not enough space for legs. Seat in front of me failed to work so less space. Staff seemed not to care about this problem. Flight arrived on schedule very slow unloading of the bags. For a budget airline it is pretty expensive. The attitude is arrogant.	0
Rouge does an injustice to Air Canada mainline. I am an AC frequent flyer and will look for alternate carriers if the only option is Rouge. Flight to Tampa on January 18th was a 18.50 departure and we got off the ground at 00.30 on the 19th. Trip home on the 23rd was delayed over 3 hours. Not sure what the issues were but weather was not one of them. I have no problem with one delay but two in a week makes me think that these folks have some issues. Seats also leave something to be desired and Rouge should be renamed Crampjet!	0
"AC1837 December 30 2014 Toronto to Phoenix Arizona. I normally enjoy flying Air Canada even tango is more preferred than other airlines. Air Canada Rouge is the least comfortable airline I've ever been on. I am 5'5"" and if I didn't sit up perfectly straight my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. My boyfriend who is 6""3' was quite a bit larger then the space that he was provided. The poor person in front of us had issues reclining because his knees were in her seat. Air Canada is great as long as there is no rouge tacked on at the end."	0
Have travelled several times between Toronto to Phoenix - always a good service. Went on Rouge the worst flight ever. Did not tell us we had to download an app to get inflight entertainment until 15 mins in the air so nothing to watch on the 5 hr flight. Packed in like cattle no leg room.	0
"Brutal seats. I am 6'4"" and could barely get into the seat. The passenger in front of me insisted on reclining his seat back. The AC Rouge website states that the slimline seats provide more room and more comfort. My legs are still swollen from the flight. The only good thing about flight 1892 YYZ to Tampa on January 16 was the inflight cabin attendants. I will never fly Rouge again."	0
For a business class ticket price this was a waste of an upgraded price. The seats do not recline far enough to rest comfortable the inflight iPad usage is really not conducive to eating in flight and your posture is compromised while viewing a the iPad needs to sit on your tray table thus causing your neck to bend downwards. I watched as passengers tried to eat while positioning their iPad here or there. It was really bothersome. It was not a comfortable flight. We fly to Maui several times a year and this is not my preferred airline for sure - Air Canada Rouge is not what I would choose to fly. I was very disappointed overall.	0
LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.	0
No entertainment from Toronto to Lisbon simply lights out. While I had entertainment from LA to Toronto my daughter had none for both legs of the trip. I can not imagine in this day and age that an airline offers no entertainment. Food was okay but you must pay for wine on international leg of trip. I think it's either BA or AF from now on.	0
YYC-LAS LAS-YYC. This itinerary was made tolerable by the fact I was able to upgrade both flights using aeroplan e credits. Very uncomfortable seats on the 319 to LAS and the so called Premium Rouge reminds me of Canadian early 90s on their 737 with the seat next to you not sold. Food was OK both flights but obviously cut rate from mainline J eg less linen. The 767 flight to YYZ was akin to narrow body J mainline in terms of seating. I am not sure what Air Canada was thinking with the IFE what are you supposed to do with that iPod while eating? And they were handed out far too late on the first flight. I did not get through the movie I was watching. If I had to wear a uniform like that to work I would not be doing so proudly! I will avoid Rouge if at all possible in the future.	0
"I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time the beginning of January. They should rename it Air Canada Sardine Can. I am only 5 foot 3 inches and my knees were hitting the seat in front of me. I dropped my glasses on the floor and there was no way I could get them and was told by the steward on the plane that there is nothing he could do that I would have to wait until the plane was empty and then I could try to reach and get them and then he said nothing else can be done and my reply was ""fly another airline"". Going into Cuba I had 3 forms to fill out and they gave them to us as we were starting to land and then told to put our trays up and we could not use the trays to fill out the forms. Very poor service and you are crammed in as I said like sardines."	0
26th September 1.5 hours late leaving London Heathrow for Montreal. Knew I would miss my connecting flight to Toronto City where I had family waiting for me. Was assured from the aircrew that Air Canada ground crew were aware of the delay and arrangements had been made to fly Toronto passengers out on two flights. All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet. After lots of chasing around from one departure gate to another I was eventually put on a flight to Toronto Pearson which resulted in my sister having to dash across Toronto at the last minute. Furthermore it seems my luggage arrived on an earlier flight isn't that a security breach? All in all a very poor service from Air Canada which has resulted in me vowing never to fly with them again going back to Air Transat.	0
VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.	1
I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are. The airplanes could be cleaned better and I do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff.	1
I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration	1
We flew on flights 4441 and 4440 on 22nd June and 29th June. Both flights were excellent, smooth, cabin staff immaculately dressed and professional. I would use this airline again. Perhaps a free snack like a sandwich or crackers and cheese would enhance the experience.	1
I am always impressed with the pleasant attitude, responsive service and  warmth of cabin crew. The ground service is good, and the food is on the good side. On the other hand, most of their planes are starting to show their age and sometimes the seats are really worn out.	1
Multiple trip with AE between SKG-FRA and MUC. Aircraft's were always clean service was fine food above average and quite good compared to other regular European airlines and the staff was always courteous and friendly. There were only couple times out of the last maybe 30 round trips the flight was delayed and that happened summertime when the European skies are congested. I have great respect for this airline and how nicely developed to become one of the best regional airlines of Europe.	1
Flew from Athens to Brussels. Aircraft was very clean and well maintained. Cabin crew were immaculately smartly turned out and friendly. In flight food was good quality. Pretty comfortable seats. No inflight entertainment though.	1
I had a very pleasant experience flying with Aer Lingus. Although the business class is not up to par with most other airlines, it is far from bad and the service was great - Irish hospitality at its best!	1
FCO-ATH-LCA-ATH all in business as using points. Easy check-in. Quality of meals and wine excellent for short . flights. Attentive staff -although as first two flights only 3 of us out of possible 8 to be expected. Really did run a separate bus on arrival for just 3 business class passengers at ATH and LCA.	1
Excellent friendly service. Able to fly in and out of Cardiff when other flights were cancelled due to fog. Maybe more expensive than alternatives, but reliable. Preferred airline on the Cardiff-Dublin route.	1
10/5 Sunday flight Dublin to LHR. Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.	1
Traveled on Aegean twice this week ATH-HER RT and ATH-MAD. All flights on time crews were polite and professional. I fly economy everywhere and expect uncomfortable seats (they were) but while I don't like it realize that's the way economy is so if flights are on time I'm satisfied. Aegean even supplied a meal in coach for the ATH-MAD flight which no USA airline does. I would fly again with Aegean and recommend.	1
You go up. You go down. Flight is over. This 20 min flight from Athens to Mykonos on an A320 does what it needs to do get you to your destination.	1
I fly LGW-DUB-LGW every fortnight. The crew are always extremely friendly considering it is 06.50am and 20.50 on the return. The service is great and they always smile  welcome everyone on board unlike the other Irish airline. However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.	1
Munich-Athens-Munich. Both flights on time very clean and comfortable Airbus A320/321 planes. Beautiful well- groomed and very nice young cabin crew only hot meals served on both flights full bar service incl very nice Greek wines. Bags delivered within 20 mins. Highly recommended.	1
LHR-ATH leg on Aegean Airlines Flight A3601 Economy. Check in with Aegean was a breeze professional and quick. Boarding was efficient and welcomed on board by polite and attentive crew with genuine smiles. Nice to see New Airbus A321 clean outside and spotless interior. Lunch consisted of tasty Greek meatballs with potatoes which was delicious. Greek salad as starter and a nice dessert. Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service. Return leg ATH-LHR was just as pleasant. Found the whole Aegean experience to be very comfortable with polite attentive crew and good service throughout. Would have no hesitation in using them again.	1
"JFK-DUB - First time flying Aer Lingus transatlantic and being Irish was looking forward to the service having previously flown Delta BA and Air France. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options. Management really need to look at what the competition are offering charging for things and being scabby on long flights is not really on in this day and age."	1
The service was great. There was enough food and it was tasty (2 full meals and snacks and drinks whenever you want). Takeoff and landing were great. Cabin crew was pleasant in general. There were some bad aspects of the flight, such as very slow entertainment system, big delay for more than 3 hours. In general the flight was good except the delay in Vladivostok airport.	1
Our nonstop flight from LED to SXF was cancelled some weeks before travel and we were re-booked on a flight via SVO which meant approximately twice the original flight time, but we had no problem getting to know a new airport. The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame. We were quite impressed by SU and would not hesitate to use them again, especially when they offer a decent rate to Asia in their new Premium Economy.	1
3/10/14 London Heathrow to Dublin Flight EI155. I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.	1
Athens-Dusseldorf. Pleasant flight catering could be better. The negative part was the ground staff (at the gate): they changed without asking us the flight by transferring us to the next flight.	1
Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.	1
SVO-PEK and back. I have travelled with Aeroflot several times within the past year I have to say that the level of service you get with this airline is inconsistent. Compared to my last trip with them (STR-SVO-LED and back) which was extremely satisfying this time the service is only so-so. For SVO-PEK the cabin crew seemed inexperienced. The crew disappeared immediately after dinner service. The food from SVO is very average and the cleanliness of the toilet was not maintained well during the flight. For the return trip the crew members seemed much more experienced and they delivered a fairly high level of service. The food was also significantly better. Overall I think Aeroflot is improving. However they still have a long way to go. As a passenger your experience with them can vary greatly depending on the crew or the route. But considering the price which was very competitive I must say that what I got for this trip was fair.	1
Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.	1
Flew with Aeroflot CPH-SVO-NRT. Excellent service. I am a tall guy and Economy Class is usually a nightmare especially on long-haul flights. On my trip to Tokyo the flight attendants noticed that I was struggling to get room for my knees and offered me one of their personal seats which had more legroom and since these seats did not have any entertainment system the crew made sure I was comfortable for giving me extra drinks. (I got a full bottle of wine for free!!) Aeroflot has become an excellent airline and I will be happy to travel with them again.	1
Flew CPH-SVO-BKK and back in economy class in brand new Boeing 777-300er. Seating a bit cramped due to the 3-4-3 configuration. I guess the only complaint is the food which was horrible. Cabin crew helpful and efficient. No alcohol policy on airline due to incidents with drunk passengers. But overall Aeroflot did a good job getting us from a to b via SVO. We would book again with Aeroflot. But a food upgrade would be nice.	1
I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737-800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight! We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.	1
MUC-SKG-ATH-HER-MUC: All flights on time with smiles clean aircraft and decent catering. Overall impeccable and a pleasure to fly!	1
I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.	1
Rio to Buenos Aires AEP on 737. Departure delayed by 30min and arrival to AEP slightly behind schedule. Plane in good condition (must say that the new livery looks better than the old one). Sandwich and drink offered during flight. Crew fine. AEP is easy to navigate. Luggage (priority tagged as FB Elite) arrived fairly quickly and first on band. Was dreading flying AR but flight was overall fine. Planning to fly them long haul in C class from Spain in May.	1
NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!	1
I traveled with my two daughters 18 and 13 years old respectively from Dulles International Airport to Moscow with Athens as our final destination. Getting there was a bit stressful because the flight connection was too close for comfort and we had to run to make the Athens flight. The crew was rather parochial. They did not speak much English and their manners were not the best. Food was poor but not horrible. Movie choices pretty decent and the actual flights were very smooth. The pilots were quite good judging by the take offs and landings. The price was unbeatable and though this was not stellar service I would choose again if their prices remained low.	1
I traveled from Tel Aviv to Toronto via Moscow. It was a last minute booking the price superb and the service excellent - especially for economy class. The food was on par for international flights but I really appreciated the courtesy of the staff. I would not hesitate to fly Aeroflot again.	1
St Petersburg - Moscow. Ticket purchased at last minute and check in a bit confusing directed to about three different counters but each without a large queue. Flight was comfortable and only a few minutes late arriving in Moscow. No IFE but it was only a little more than a hour long flight. Cabin crew were friendly and responsive and spoke reasonable English. It was like a shuttle flight and perfectly adequate. Leg room was adequate.	1
Larnaca - Rhodes return. Both flights on time comfy seats and friendly cabin crew. No inflight entertainment probably because it was a short flight but a good experience to fly with Aegean.	1
Flew LAX-SVO-Yervan and back I was concerned having heard mixed reviews but was pleasantly surprised! Flights were on time baggage arrived perfectly the colors and atmosphere on the plane was bright and cheery. I flew economy so like any other airlines you get what you pay for as far as cabin space however in all other respects Aeroflot was superior. Cabin crew were professional and polite food was quite good. Entertainment was superb with 100's of great movies and shows to choose from as well as games wifi charging stations and all the works! I travelled with my children 4 and 7 and had no trouble keeping them busy for 12 hours. Children's meals can be pre-ordered and were well thought out although my picky ones didn't eat them. Kids got tons of goodies from the staff. The value was great and I will fly with them again in the future. My only complaint were the tiny and rather dirty bathrooms. Otherwise excellent airline!	1
Flew Istanbul-Athens. Plane was new and clean staff warm and friendly and they served drinks and a sandwich on this 1-hour flight. This airline deserves more than a 3-star ranking in my opinion.	1
STR-SKG-ATH-TLV. Slightly delayed departure in STR but arrival on time in ATH after short stop in SKG. Great food and good selection of beverages. Departure from ATH was several hours delayed due to striking ground staff. Received vouchers for snacks. Definitively recommended.	1
Shanghai to Tehran return July 2012. Direct flight to Tehran. Economy class. Aircraft A310. Fare was quite good. Check-in fast. Cabin crew showed Iranian hospitality. No individual inflight entertainment but fairly speaking since the flight was at night. One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai. Considering all the above I will certainly choose this airline next time for my trip to Tehran.	1
LGW-BHD EI021 31 July 14. Excellent customer service and particularly impressed with clear communication and politeness of cabin manager on this flight. A320 seats much more comfortable than the A319s that EI also operate on this route.	1
Dublin to SFO - good seat space good inflight entertainment pleasant crew flight on time dinner and snack tasted good. From SFO to Dublin - all was good as above except for the meals these were tasteless.	1
LED-SVO-STR. Very good experience overall. Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent. I think it is really time to change the stereotype that many of us had for the Russian national carrier for many years!	1
Aegean started regular non-stop flights between IEV and ATH in Spring 2013. The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage. Overall experience is good would definitely fly again for a reasonable price.	1
Excellent service and courteous employees. I flew from Puerto Vallarta and had to change planes in Mexico City for flight to Los Angeles. One glitch - my bag was put on a later flight ( about 30 to 40 minutes) along with 20 to 30 other travelers. It was frustrating standing around and wondering until an announcement was finally made.	1
FRA-ATH. May 25. A321. Boarding totally messy. Excellent food and drinks. Extremely pleasant staff. Luggage arrived very quickly.	1
We recently traveled on 3 domestic flights within Argentina - Buenos Aires - Iguazu - Salta - Buenos Aires. We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.	1
My wife and I flew from PEK-LHR with a tight 50 minute connection at SVO. Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors. And price wise they are way ahead of the game. It's a shame they use SVO as their hub however.	1
SKG-ATH-FCO return. A320 and A321. All flights about 70% full. Clean cabin friendly and nice crew comfortable seats. Food ok just a sandwich and free drinks. Smooth flights and arrivals ahead of schedule.	1
Flew with Aer Lingus to Boston on flight EI 139. Economy. Flew on the A330 to and from. Excellent plane. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the €17.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this. Unfortunately I couldn't get this meal on the way back sold out. However the meal we got was still lovely. Overall would like to fly with Aer Lingus in the future again. Would recommend them.	1
AM633 on 21 August SAT-MEX and AM632 on August 25 MEX-SAT. Short trip from SAT to MEX and return on Embraer jet. First time on AM and it was a terrific experience crew were efficient aircraft clean and very well maintained. Snack service was tasty with fresh choices and excellent bar service. I will gladly take AM again as my travel plans permit.	1
We fly Aeromexico JFK to Cancun. We use them whenever we can. The reasons are many but here are some. The crew are very accommodating and always courteous. We enjoy having food to eat. If there is an empty seat after takeoff we were allowed to move. The plane was new.	1
Flew from Bristol to Dublin for the Giro D'Italia using Aer Lingus Regional (Aer Arran). Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.	1
Flew JFK-SVO-BEY-SVO-JFK. The price of ticket was 200$-300$ cheaper than the price of a ticket with other airlines. All flights were ok. If not on time either late by a couple of minutes or early by a couple of minutes. IFE great. Staff OK. One of the things I didn't like is the food. It is edible but it is always beef or chicken with a salad or cheese with ham (on all flights) the meals are not diversified. I didn't like the seats. I'm 190cm so it was really uncomfortable for me to sit in this seat for a flight of 9-10hrs but it shouldn't be the same problem for someone shorter. Airport is good. Staff is friendly. Terminal D and E are new and spacious but terminal F is over crowded and there is a lot of stores and not a lot of places to sit. Overall the experience was good. Will take them again and recommend them to someone if price is good.	1
Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!	1
Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.	1
JFK-MEX-ZIH and return. JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.	1
Paris-Athens-Mytilini. Compared to the competition this is the only option for Greece. Friendly service good hot food at lunch and evening flight with wine seat comfortable aircraft modern clean and on time. Overall very good.	1
ATH-FRA. Another great experience with Aegean on a clean and relatively new aircraft with a meal served by polite and caring crew. Although a moving map was displayed throughout the cabin a movie or some other form of entertainment would have been appreciated for this 3-hour flight (I flew Aegean to London before and a movie was shown). Regardless this airline is a pleasure to fly.	1
Flew YYZ-MOW-YYZ. Both flights were excellent. Sheremetyevo airport very modern comfortable there was barely any line-up for customs and security screenings. Security was painless compared to the US and Canadian ones. Food was great I asked for an extra meal on both flights and they gave it to me. The offered wine for free in economy class. FA also friendly. The only concern is the delays. When I flew there the delay was 40 min on the way back the washroom broke down in the aircraft so the delay was 4 hours. They gave us meal vouchers so we got free food at SVO.	1
Moscow-Tenerife on A330-300 long haul. The service was incredible (actually as usual on Aeroflot long haul flights in business class compared to short haul it is better). Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good. Entertainment system has a big variety of films and all films can be watched in either Russian or English. In my opinion Aeroflot on long hauls is much better than the majority of other European airlines.	1
Charter service from Tel Aviv to Heraklion. A320 new and clean all leather seats. Only drinks served. All female crew seemed completely disinterested. Airshow available however no position of the aircraft available only the map of the area. Heard good things about A3 service however that was not the experience we had.	1
LYS-ORN. Clean and new aircraft FA's could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.	1
I have flown a number of long distance and internal flights and am pleased with the airline. The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom. The website is great and service when things go wrong is also friendly and good.	1
Flight SU23/SU2618 LED-SVO / SVO-BRU 23/06/2013. Check in at Poltava was OK. It was possible to check in for the connecting flight to Brussels. Flight LED-SVO got a delay of almost 25 minutes. Probably the delay was caused by the used plane (Airbus A330 i.o. A320). It takes more time to board 320 people instead of 120. Plane was clean service on board was OK. Staff very friendly. Due to the delay our transit time was extremely short. We had to run to catch the connecting flight. Connecting flight was on schedule. Plane (Airbus 319) was clean service on board was great. We arrived on time in Brussels and unbelievably our luggage was on board and arrived as well!	1
Madrid - Dublin EI 595 22/12/13. Check/baggage drop in Madrid (sub contractor) slow inefficient. Aircraft clean comfortable. Punctuality slight delay on departure arrival on time. Flight attendants efficient friendly and very professional. Greatly improved offerings of food on board at reasonable prices. Baggage delivered speedily on arrival in Dublin. Altogether excellent flight and service. They do however need to watch that they are not let down by ground handling agents.	1
Flew Aerolineas/Austral on a domestic flight AEP-IGR and I have nothing to complain about. Check-in was good. Fairly new planes (E190) with IFE even for this short flight of slightly less than 2 hours. Was served a sandwich and something to drink.	1
"11/11/2013 my companion and I flew from San Antonio to Chicago and there caught Aer Lingus Flight EI124. The Aircraft was an Airbus 330. The Senior Crew Flight attendant was a very compassionate woman who attended to us and all of those around us with interest and tenacity. The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44"" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well. We had the same seats on the opposite side of the cabin. The amenities of even economy class on this Airline are excellent and a great value. The equipment is first class and the crew made me proud to be Irish American."	1
Hamburg-Moscow-Shanghai. HAM-SVO on A320 smooth check-In with 2 boarding passes (HAM-SVO and SVO- PVG). C-lounge with basic refreshment. HAM-SVO C class cabin seat and service were excellent. Arrival at SVO new Terminal D quick and easy transit at both passport/security. SVO-PVG departed from Terminal F very long walkway from D to F. Terminal F awful old/dark/busy. Lounge at Terminal F was difficult to find. I was refused entry because I did not have the invitation card. Had to go to transit desk. After entering I noted the lounge was full no seat available. Flight to Shanghai on time with new and clean A330. Seats 2-2-2 not full flat but comfortable to sleep. Good onboard service greeting by purser/crews with good English skill. Foods (3 choices) very tasty. AVOD with 500 programs. Return: quick check-in with 2 boarding passes good spacious lounge. Flight PVG-SVO at 1.30 am. Old/tired B767 seat 2-2-2 narrow and less comfortable than A330 portable IFE with DVD-player same good onboard service. Landed at Terminal F and lesson learned went to transit desk asking for C-Lounge Access card. SVO-HAM A320 left Terminal D on time with best European C Class cabin I have flown. Good products with following minus points: No priority boarding on all legs no priority handling of baggage chaotic handling at SVO Airport.	1
CMN-BRU. For a LCC Air Arabia has been a welcome surprise. They offer you 20 kg baggage allowance new airplanes decent seats and a fresh crew. For a price/quality comparison they are better than Air Maroc. But their website is often malfunctioning certain routes are deleted without notice time tables suddenly change and they often leave at ungodly hours. I'm satisfied with this airline and will keep flying them if they keep their standards to the current level.	1
AEP-FTE in Club Economy. Check-in at AEP was confusing proceeded to departure lounge upstairs. There is no VIP saloon at this airport for Club Economy passengers. Equipment was an old MD88 that was worn. No IFE. Seat pitch was around 35” or so. A lunch box was distributed shortly after take off - a stale sandwich a packaged cake and a pack of nuts. Drink service followed and FA's disappeared. No second round of drinks. Toilet was dirty. For a 3 hour flight I would expect a more substantive meal in the “premium” cabin. My bags were amongst the last to come out despite marked “priority” on the tag.	1
Delay of more than 12 hours. Rude and unhelpful staff in Moscow lack of any kind of information post service inexistent. On the way back from MAD to BKK first flight got delayed 2.5 hours so when we arrive in SVO connection to BKK had already departed. Instead of giving us a hotel they gave us a boarding pass to Seoul! We arrived to Seoul without any idea of what to do next nobody say anything to us no information. There they gave us a boarding pass to BKK with Korean airlines for 6 hours later. Arrive into Bangkok with more than 12 hours delay they inform us that our bags were still in Moscow. The worst customer service.	1
ATH-LHR A320. Flight arrived in London early but luggage delivery so slow in T1 it didn't make any difference. Decent service food horrible as always. New and clean plane. Decent movie onboard.	1
Feb 8 2013 flight AM192 MEX-PVR Embraer 170. My first time on this type of aircraft. I liked the large windows and larger seats. One thing though leather seats tend to have you slide down and slouch. Flight was on time staff friendly bags delivered by the time I had deplaned.	1
Astana-Istanbul-Astana on March 16-18 2015. It was one of my best flight experiences starting from check-in inflight meal offering and friendly approach of flight attendants. It was worth every cent I paid.	1
Staff excellent customer service oriented meals are good and the planes are new. The seats are comfortable and lounge in Athens has a smoking area that is not packed.	1
12/2/15 KS942/952 London - Almaty. 21/2/15 KS601/941 Almaty - London. You really get the feeling with Air Astana that the company is genuinely striving for improvement all the time. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful planes are really clean flights generally arrive on time. The new economy sleeper is a winning option for people who dread the loss of a nights sleep but cannot bring themselves to fork out the full business class fare. I travelled with my four children and we all thought economy sleeper was brilliant. At least a chance of sleep much more space quieter cabin and better food that in economy.	1
I have often flown Aegean and I always look forward to. Nice service only bad thing - occasionally you book with Aegean and end up having a return flight or a second leg with an inferior company. Make sure you check what connections and return flights are involved.	1
Flight KC930 24 February. Return trip from Hong Kong in mid February. Plane was very delayed but informed. Could in my view been done earlier but was nice to be told a couple of hours in advance. Trip itself was pleasant. Good inflight entertainment and again the inflight crew did an excellent job and were responsive to needs. Food could be improved as compared to other airlines traveled but do note it is economy class.	1
ALA-TSE. B757-200 not new AC but fully refurbished to perfection. Clean and inviting. Crew very well groomed wonderful IFE tasty hot snack on this 80 min flight. Temp however was very high in the cabin and my req to lower it a bit were not fulfilled. I started to feel ill and asked for ice to cool my head crew showed no empathy or care. I was glad it was a short flight.	1
GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.	1
LHR-ATH-JMK. Bags were transferred seamlessly at Athens which was my main concern. LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.	1
HAM-SVO-HAM first time with AFL-Business class. Check In at Hamburg very quick. Shared Lounge with acceptable refreshments. Boarding well organized. The big surprise was the C Class cabin. It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D. SVO- HAM also at Terminal D - quick Check-In / AFL own lounge without window but offers better quality and quantity of refreshments than Hamburg lounge. Return flight with same great experience. AFL offers an excellence Business class product much better than those established European Airlines.	1
LAX-MEX-GRU in Business. Very fast check-in at LAX however the lounge wasn't open which was awkward. Flight to MEX was comfortable however the flight attendant couldn't be bothered to do anything with the meal and the omelette was served cold. Club Premier lounge in DF was great with food wine and showers. Flight to Sao Paulo was average food was great however I didn't think the seat was as comfortable as LAN. All in all decent - much better than an American airline to S America.	1
Excellent fast and efficient. Flew JFK-MEX on their red-eye flight. Did Web check-in and made a quick baggage drop. Movie and two TV episodes as inflight entertainment. A nice sandwich for midnight snack/dinner. Early Departure and early arrival to MEX. Bags were already waiting in carrousel after arrival.	1
Athens - Heathrow route. Arrived at terminal 1 30mins late due to air traffic. Had another 2.5 hrs to collect baggage and check in at terminal 5 for a domestic flight on BA. A fast walk to the baggage claim took about 20mins and thereafter waited another 30mins for the baggage to arrive. By the time someone accepted us at one of the many empty counters it was already too late. We missed our connection I strongly recommend allowing at least 4 hrs to connect from terminal 1 to 5. The airline itself is very good. Clean and new A321 friendly flight crew and free drinks onboard meal was average.	1
Having flown several times with Aer Lingus decided to upgrade to their Business Class cabin from Manchester to Chicago via Dublin. Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch. Overall great experience and have already booked Business Class for my next trip to Boston in October.	1
Mixed business and economy between Manchester and Boston. Staff provided warm professional service - first rate. Experience from check-in to baggage claim was hassle free. Business class food was great - much better than expected. Seat was very comfortable. Really good value for money - certainly will fly with them again.	1
AMS-KJA-AMS. Boarding in Amsterdam was the horror - more than half an hour at the business class check in and total mess in the departure area. AMS-SVO was okay. Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.	1
SYD-RUN-SEZ. Very attentive crew . Good and adequate food crew offering water . Leather seats comfortable and clean 777-300. More IFE options of movies and other programmes would make it better.	1
Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.	1
Salta-Puerto Iguazu domestic flight operated by Austral. Flight a Embraer 190 with personal entertainment with TV series and documentaries and some CD's. The entertainment system failed twice but the crew reactivated it quick. Did not expected entertainment on a domestic flight. The crew offered a sandwich with a drink. Good legroom at emergency exit but the normal seats also offered good legroom for this short flight of 1.5 hrs. Departed 2O mins early and landed 40 mins early in Iguazu.	1
CDG-RUN-ZSE. Outstanding service for the economy class good food very nice ground staff and crew. Fleet is modern with B777 with high quality entertainment system. Seat pitch tight and slightly cramped. RUN airport is small and allows very short connecting time if need to continue journey to east or Saint Pierre airport.	1
Recently flew throughout Myanmar on the following routes: Yangon-Mandalay-Heho-Mandalay-Nyaung U (Bagan)-Heho-Thandwe-Yangon on their Fokker 100 and ATR72 aircraft. Check-in interesting as there are no computers and everything is weighed manually. Ground crew cordial but not overly friendly. Flight crews were friendly and always helpful. Catering is good for the short flights with croissants and drinks being offered on even the shortest of flights (unthinkable in Europe). Aircraft's were always spotless and comfortable.	1
MIA-MEX on Boeing 737 and MEX-DGO on Embraer 190. Clean modern aircraft. Served breakfast and drinks by friendly flight crew. Flights on time and terminal 2 in Mexico city airport out is amazing.	1
Have travelled with Aegean a number of times already and service is impeccable. Ground crew eager to help and facilitate flights on time comfortable journeys with nice meals on board.	1
Flight KC912 April 2nd from Istanbul to Almaty. It was a fantastic flight crew helpful and smiling. All announcements very clear understandable and most important things for me multi-language Turkish English Russian and Kazakh. The way aircraft was new.	1
IAH-MEX-IAH economy. First leg on B738 and E190 on the way back. Comfortable flights given that I had cheapest economy ticket and got seated in premium seat in the front of the aircraft on an outbound flight. Some breakfast items on quite a short flights were a nice touch and crew were friendly. Good value for money.	1
I flew May 3rd NYC-MOSCOW connection MOSCOW-KIEV $1500 2 adult tickets. The flight was great! On time and arrived early in Moscow on a nice Airbus A330. The plane was fairly new. The seats bathrooms and interior of the plane was excellent. The food on the transatlantic flight there and back were both great. Chicken or fish with veggies bread and chocolate. The only complaint I would make is they serve the drinks and wait too long to serve the food. They served the drinks 15 mins before the food was served so by the time I got my food I had no drink. The service was 7 of 10. The flight from Moscow to Kiev was excellent as well. 1hr and 15mins on time. Overall Aeroflot is a good airline I would fly with them again!	1
Have made several flights with Aegean Airlines in the past year. It was very good value for money. Flights mostly on time inflight service exceptional and friendly FA's. Helpful ground staff. Overall this will be my preferred carrier to Greece.	1
Mexico City - Cancun return. Clean modern 737 aircraft that departed on time professional bi-lingual flight attendants. Inflight service consisted of just a drink service (with free booze) and a pack of peanuts. Their terminal 2 at Mexico City is a beautiful modern facility. Its just a shame they don't offer online check in or self service check in.	1
LAX-Acapulco via MEX. We booked via Delta so expected to pay for baggage and have no meals. But Aeromexico baggage still free and nice meals on long leg of trip both ways. Drink and snack on 35 minute Acapulco-MEX leg. Staff were charming and helpful. We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous. The headrest appears to have been designed for crash test dummies. We had been much more comfortable in our coach seats.	1
Dublin - Santiago return. Both flights on time. Excellent service from Irish cabin crew. Food for purchase but reasonably priced and tasty. Only complaint was lack of staff at passport control in Dublin so long queues. Cant understand. Felt sorry for All non EU passport holders. Not Aer Lingus fault but only glitch in otherwise faultless travel experience.	1
PEK-ALA-TSE-SVO. Red-eye flight from Beijing to Almaty on B757-200. The aircraft is old but well-attended. Seats are ok. Cabin crew speak good English. Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us. They were very helpful and the ground crew were efficient because our baggage arrived safely at SVO. I would recommend Air Astana if the prices are adequate.	1
MAD-EZE return. On the upper deck on the way to Argentina: service was good food as well - seat worked and slept nearly the whole flight. On the way back on the much smaller lower deck flight attendant was somewhat short-sighted and set everyone in wrong seats - we had our laughs. Seat was a bit broken but found some sleep. Food wasn't so good on the flight back to Europe.	1
MEX-LIM. Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).	1
MUC-ATH. The seating was standard European Business with the middle seat blocked. The highlight of the flight was the meal which was a pasta dish with shrimp calamari and tomato sauce - simply excellent. Friendly crew and good service as well as the meal.	1
LHR-ATH-LHR. Booked at the last minute because of the BA strike. BMI lounge excellent at T1 Swissport lounge at Athens almost as good. Modern clean A321-200 seats 2A/C outbound  1D/F inbound. FAs excellent. Food service rather rushed outbound with no pre-lunch drinks and no offer of champagne pre take-off. Food average quality but good to have the Greek accent. Food service and quality similar inbound and still no sign of champagne. IFE unusually provided on a 4 hr flight but consisted of just a single film on overhead drop-down LCD screens. Priority baggage return worked remarkably well both outbound and inbound and the general efficiency of the new Athens airport was a delight. Overall a good product.	1
I have travelled many times with Aegean Airlines from Berlin to Athens Athens to Larnaca but also in domestic flights in Greece. In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.	1
EDITORIAL MESSAGE Due to concerns about authenticity of the review submitted and/or the user's name being that of the airline customer as stated on their submit form this comment has been deleted.	1
BOG to EZE on a relatively new 737. Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.	1
I flew from JFK to Dublin in June. Everything went extremely smoothly from luggage check in to luggage pick up. The personnel on the ground and on board was extremely friendly and efficient. The only drawback of the airline is the food selection and quality.	1
Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.	1
Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR. All in all it was a great flight no delays staff were extremely friendly as always check-in was simple and they also offered to check in my carry on luggage free of charge. If Aer Lingus flew from Stansted I'd fly with them anytime I was going home.	1
SVO-MUC. I didn't expect too much and therefore I was really surprised by the airline and the new terminal at Sheremetyevo airport. The crew members were friendly and could speak good English. Very good hot meal and comfortable seats. I was very satisfied.	1
Dublin - JFK on Dec 17 2012. The cabin crew were warm and helpful. I hadn't requested a vegetarian meal but the stewardess was nice enough to bring me extra salads and rolls. They came by often with drink service and to collect trash. The movies and shows available were great. I'm a very nervous flyer and as we were preparing to land a stewardess talked me through it and was very comforting.	1
ZRH-DUS-MIA and return in business class. Short flights okay (only coach class but they kept the seat next to me free). Business class seats fully flat really great if you sleep on the side (otherwise might be a bit short) staff extremely friendly meals rather uninspired (I had a pre-ordered vegetarian meal). Entertainment has a nice selection however I slept most of the time. Would fly with Air Berlin in business class.	1
PEK-ALA-SVO. Both flights arrived on time. Good food and excellent alcohol selection. Service friendly and efficient. PEK-ALA on 767 and ALA-SVO on 321 old but well maintained. Generous legroom. No individual entertainment. Overall very good value for money.	1
SEN-DUB-SEN: First time travelling with this airline and have to say very impressed. Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.	1
"HKG-SVO. Overall good flight but service could have been better for business class. Old looking cabin on A300. FA's older and quite reserved. No repeat servings and one had to ask for a drink refill. Catering good from HKG and meal very tasty. Seat comfort is ok but not designed for taller person. Priority luggage tags mean nothing with Aeroflot almost for sure your ""priority"" tagged luggage will show up last! Result was 55 mins wait at the luggage belt for delivery. SVO airport F terminal chaos at customs as usual."	1
NYC-SVO-KBP on A330-300 and A321. Prior to the flight newspapers were distributed. We were then stuck in a jam while taxiing prior to take-off. Service onboard was plain and overall very correct. I have low interest in IFE though the little I tried seemed quite correct. We were served dinner and breakfast the former with wine. We arrived on time. The transfer went smoothly and the second leg was as pleasant as the other. The fare was 30-40% cheaper than on other airlines doing the route. Great value for money and solid level of quality.	1
BUD-SVO-DEL with quite new A330-300. All flights were on time. Onboard service was great. Comfortable seats and great entertainment lot of movies music and games. Meals were lovely on BUD-SVO flight - cold meal with two drinks juice and coffee/tea. On SVO-DEL flight warm meal was served - they gave us menu before dinner so we could choose. Lot of drinks served. Cabin staff can be more polite.	1
Glasgow to Orlando via Dublin. Excellent service for the second time this year. The short flight Glasgow to Dublin is on a prop plane but is perfectly adequate for the short distance. Dublin-Orlando includes good entertainment food and most courteous cabin crew. A330 was very clean.	1
LHR-SVO-PVG returning PEK-SVO-LHR. Nice A321 to Moscow with good meal. Sheveremeteyvo Airport Terminals DE and F now interlinked though website states still bus link. B767's are old and on boarding it was noticeable that the interior had not been refurbished. Once airborne the service and food excellent. The seats were comfortable and the overhead TV had some good films. Return flight from Beijing on new Airbus A330-300 very pleasant and comfortable. Good personal seatback entertainment system with very wide screens for economy class. Lots of choice though some movies not up to date. Food good again. A321 to LHR only half full cabin crew pleasant and attentive food fine and only problem was that cabin lights not dimmed for night flight.	1
ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc). If possible please consider other supplier of noise-reducing earplugs those available in the passenger's pouch now don't reduce the noise and pressure discomfort in the cabin.	1
Alicante to Dublin on 27/10/2012. Although the flight was a little late leaving Alicante due to slow loading of passengers and hand luggage the actual journey was a pleasant experience. I thought all the staff were friendly and courteous. Arriving into Dublin well after midnight all the staff were still smiling and pleasant as passengers disembarked. I will travel again with EI as long as staff continue to smile and look like they care about passengers.	1
Dublin - Boston Return. Both flights on time. Great to clear USA immigration in Dublin. Inflight service outbound efficient but staff not as friendly as normal. Inbound staff excellent nothing too much trouble. Inflight entertainment good but on return had to ask for it to be turned on for the whole aircraft. Staff forgot. Then it had to be rebooted. All told took an hour before the IFE was up and running. All flights on time. Seats standard economy seats but comfortable enough. Great to be domestic flight into the USA. Took 15 mins from getting off the aircraft to kerbside.	1
BRU-SVO-LED PEK-SVO-BRU. Short haul flights with A320. Lots of legroom new planes. Long haul flight with new A330-300 legroom ok but bad seats who got pretty painful after a while good IFE with pretty good selection of movies. General comments : staff is good but not too enthusiastic. Food average. You have to pay for alcoholic drinks on long haul flights (alcohol banned on some flights).	1
We flew ORD to TXL on July 31 and TXL to ORD on Aug. 18. After years and years of flying with UA and having to transfer in Europe it was a relief to fly non-stop to Berlin. The cabin was clean the staff was very helpful and the food was quite acceptable. The seats were comfortable. We had requested wheelchair assistance at both ends and it was ready and waiting.	1
We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket with two little ones. Flight was a bit shaky due to monsoon season nothing that captain could do about it the aircraft was new clean food was fine crew very attentive especially the young male attendant on the way back who was superb. The seats were fine too but when the person in front reclined his seat there was unfortunately not much space to move especially with the little one on your laps. Overall it was very pleasant experience and we will fly with Air Berlin again.	1
Atyrau to Almaty - friendly service with right amount of attention 3 meal choices excellent legroom great selection of music. Most comfortable.	1
Travelled with Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Aer Arann) return from Birmingham to Shannon. Flights early in both directions. flight attendants attentive and friendly. Plane on outward journey was 23 years old! Seats were old and tatty but nonetheless clean and comfortable. Return flight on a modern aircraft which was in immaculate condition. Comfortable leather seats made the journey more endurable and the plane was spotless.	1
PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.	1
GUW-ALA in Y and ALA-URA in C; both flights on older and somewhat stuffy 757s which however have generous legroom in economy and plenty of space in business. Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).	1
AMS-DUB October 9th and back again October 12th. Both times just after 1PM. No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far. Good value for money I'd use them again but not for a flight with a layover since (small) delays seem to be common.	1
DUB-BOS return JFK-DUB. Service was very good steward was friendly and attentive food on the flight from Dublin to Boston two levels higher to rate than on the flight home (over seasoned crab cakes and greasy) I immediately got a different menu offered.	1
BOS-DUB-BCN return. A333's between BOS and DUB were clean comfortable and had great entertainment systems. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the service was very good. A320's between DUB and BCN were clean and a little less leg room. They charged for everything including water. When boarding in BCN they weighed our carry on luggage (never had carry ons weighed on any airline ever before including the flight to BCN) one was a bit over so we had to check it at an extra 50 euro.	1
Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.	1
Geneva to HK via Moscow. Aeroflot was good for the given price. The customer service was up to the mark (eg. I didnt confirm veg meal while booking but attendant once informed remembered to bring me veg meal with a smile). I found it to be a cultural thing with the russians which you should be open enough to accept it. Things can be little chaotic at Moscow airport. Check which airplanes they are flying on given routes and make booking accordingly - Airbus they had were new.	1
GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.	1
Bangkok to Budapest through Moscow. The plane leg room and food were ok nothing too great but adequate. Entertainment is rather limited especially when you are offered the same films on the way back. Passengers were sober and quiet but they did not react security calls and moved around cabins in a random manner. A huge queue to go through a single transit desk in Moscow. One machine - a real embarrassment. Airport is a 19th Century with coffee costing £5. We needed some help with finding a gate. I approached 6 airport staff - all were abrupt rude and unhelpful (I am bi-lingual and tried both languages). Staff in the plane were polite but still no smiles as in other airlines. There were numerous delays in all locations. I have to say that the price was very good so will go again. Please smile more and show more films.	1
KBP-SVO and consider it the best option between Kiev and Moscow. I was promised 500 miles for online check in which didn't work. Airport check in a breeze. Boarding was chaotic A321 spotless with good seat pitch. Fast baggage delivery. Onboard experience was somewhat spoilt with inedible breakfast snack and young crew members who looked lost and helpless. English announcements were hard to comprehend.	1
Milan-Berlin-Antalya and return via Dusseldorf: a reasonably enjoyable experience although Berlin Tegel was possibly the worst 'airport experience' I can remember for a long time especially as I had a 4 hour layover stuck in what seemed like a make-shift demountable building plus use of a few old steel chairs. Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time). Priority luggage does not appear to be recognised. All in all quite a pretty good experience and which reminded me for the benefit of my fellow countrymen very much like some of the better Jetstar flights and experiences in Australia.	1
"Oslo-Berlin (Tegel). Boeing 737-700 round trip. Same equipment. Check in was fast both ways. We checked in 1 bag. You can have 1 free (23kg) bag checked in. Pretty much left gate on time both ways. Seats were comfortable but jiggly. I got the seat of the passenger sitting in front of me in my lap during take off both ways. Air Berlin says on their website state they will give you a free non alcoholic drinks and a Ham/Cheese sandwich on flights over 90min. We got a choice of ""sweet or salty"". Note: If you choose ""sweet"" you will get a waffle bar. If you choose ""salty"" you will get a bag of chilli potato chips. Drink choices of coke products and juice/coffee. It would have been nice if they asked if you want a ""waffle bar"" or a ""bag of potato chips"" because I was confused. An overall average flight. Left on time and landed on time. Good value for money."	1
I fly Air Berlin every 2-3 weeks long haul from Europe to Miami doing the same flights all the time. One thing that stands out is that they are not consistent. The crew (under-staffed) do not work as a tight team and so the service is often all over the place. Being a TopBonus Gold member makes no difference at all except for priority check-in lounge access and pre-aboard. I always fly economy and choose to sit at the back I usually miss a choice of meal the seat next to me is rarely kept free and the regular collection of rubbish from your seat is very poor or non-existent. I often disembark with a seat pocket full of rubbish or I take it with me to the toilets during the flight. When pressing the call button they attend to your seat turn the call button off and then a give quick glance to see if you actually wanted anything. Water is given to you in a bottle there is no mid-flight juice/water service. When boarding they have 1-2 crew members greeting passengers while the rest stand in the galley no effort to emerge and help people find seats store luggage etc. I fly Etihad frequently and am shocked at the tie-up the two airlines have - complete opposites when it comes to service. I have a tomato allergy for which I can rarely get a special meal so when boarding I ask them to make sure they put aside a meal that does not contain tomato this request is often met with no response or an attitude of that is a lot of work of 14 in the last year only once did a crew member actually give me a crew meal. I now take my own food. Have tried several times to upgrade to business class with miles but never been able too. On a positive note the long- haul aircraft is modern IFE is excellent and seat comfort is ok and they are nearly always on-time. I have flown business class a few times and they are excellent - there is however only two business class cabin crew for 19-20 people so if full I imagine service would be different when I have flown there is only a 10-12 people in business class.	1
ZRH to TXL and back in mid-November 2013. As an OW Sapphire member I was able to reserve a seat for free in advance additionally because I made the seat reservation only 3 days prior to departure I was able to obtain an XL seat free of charge which is something that Air Berlin normally does not offer its OW partner members. On the flight to TXL the plane type was changed without advance notice so I ended up with a normal seat but on the way back I enjoyed the larger legroom. I must say that if you're taller than 6'2 the normal seats are at the limit of what one could call comfortable. Though there is no pain or pressure in any way. The fare cost less than 5$ the rest made up of various taxes and fees and it ended up costing me around 120$. I like the fact that overall the service was good enough for this amount of low fare. Along with the good public transport connections in ZRH and TXL door-to-door cost me 135$. Departure was on time in both cases. Staff was friendly in both cases though there was nothing special about food and beverages being offered. No inflight entertainment at all bring your own.	1
BHX-DUB-JFK outbound BOS-DUB-BHX inbound. Outbound: BHX very quiet no queue for check-in all on time A320 clean the seat is fine for such a short flight. At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport. Overall very happy and I think this will now be my preferred route to the East Coast saves the trek to LHR.	1
JFK-DUB-NAP. Seasonal route to Naples. Outstanding product service and price. Beats any US airline. Professional pilots and FA pleasant and clean cabin A330-300 decent pitch IFE. Armrest does not raise all the way. DUB-NAP on clean A320 Sky Deli edible enough price competitive with airport. Return DUB-JFK A330 bulk seat 9D in private cabin behind Business. Cool spot IFE screen folds with armrest. DUB T2 is small and efficient transfer.	1
Air Berlin domestic TXL-DUS-TXL 737-800. Though almost fully booked on both ways boarding was smoothly (maybe due to new boarding process). Crew - as always at Air Berlin - a bit of a mixed box: varying from friendly with a personal touch to absolutely indifferent. Seat quality and choice of snacks and beverages very good for a short hop. Arrival 5 min late both ways - so almost on time. All in all good domestic product and value for money.	1
WAW-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-WAW. Flight from WAW to TXL on a new Bombardier Q400 short and smooth. Flights from TXL to AUH and from AUH to HKT on the A330-200 were half empty so it was very comfortable having 4 seats in the middle row to sleep all by myself. Same thing on the way back. Service was great as well I can't complain at all.	1
I was hesitant to book this airline going to Osaka due to the negative reviews here but it was the cheapest option. To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again.	1
